GREEN PARTY
COMHAONTAS GLAS
MANIFESTO
INTRODUCTION
Many politicians from the established parties have
tried to give their own interpretations of Green politics.
They believe they can 'capture the Green vote' by
making statements on the 'environment'
This
fashionable 'environmental' approach to our present
pollution problems deals merely with the symptoms.
But truly Green politics goes much deeper than that.
The Green approach is an ecological one - it goes
back to the root causes.
All of the Green Party's policies acknowledge the
vital importance of Ecology, that is, our whole
environment
Our whole future is vitally dependent on
that environment
We depend upon a network of links
with the rest of creation
Green politics acknowledges
the reality and importance of that web of Life.
Over the years human beings have set themselves
up to dominate and exploit the planet
Many of the
problems which the Greens have long predicted (they
were called 'alarmist' for doing so) are now coming to
pass
It is now clear that if our warnings are ignored
much longer humankind will destroy the planet.
The potential catastrophes which we face are finally
beginning to convince people that the existing power
structures cannot be trusted
The policies of traditional
Left, Right and Centre have been abject failures
Their
promises of unlimited growth, a technological 'fix' for
all our problems and universal affluence are false
The
unbridled consumerism of the developed countries is
the root cause of the poverty of two thirds of the world's'
human family
Conventional politics cannot supply an
adequate answer to our dilemma
If planet Earth is to
have a future, a totally new, radical, spiritual approach
will have to be adopted - an approach which holds
that the
fundamental problem
is our materialistic
society
We can no longer ignore the spiritual dimension
of our lives in the interests of selfish consumerism.
In this manifesto you will find well-thought-out
policies on the environment, agriculture and urban
conservation
But these policies are fundamentally
linked - in a truly ecological sense - to our policies
on employment and economics.
When you have studied our manifesto we hope you
will agree that the Green approach provides the best
hope of achieving the sort of future you really want for
yourself and your children.
BACKGROUND
In recent times the very survival of planet Earth has
become a matter of grave anxiety to vast numbers of
people
Acid rain, the destruction of our forests, the
projected Greenhouse Effect, the threat to the ozone
layer, have all reached world headlines and become
topics of daily conversation in millions of homes
At the
same time people are fearful about purely economic
affairs: unemployment and the erosion of security, unfair forms of taxation and so on
We believe there is
a strong link between our economic and ecological
problems: both are due to the excesses of the system
of industrialism.
The system of large-scale, industrial factory
organisation has helped to despoil the planet of its
mineral and energy resources, is at the root of
widespread pollution and ecological destruction, has
"caused us to feel we are not at home in the world, has
led to the widespread regimentation of social life, and
currently threatens the Earth with destruction
While
we condemn the excesses of industrialism as a "wrong
turn" in human development we do not condemn
technology itself - merely inappropriate technology
and its wasteful and dehumanising use.
We are therefore fundamentally opposed to the
following: growth economics; consumerism; the
worship of technique; and the state of mind which
, holds work, regardless of its quality in practice or
product, to be an end in itself
Growth economics
values growth in the quantity of goods produced over
growth in the quality of life; consumerism places
"having" over being; the unthinking worship of
technology means that no thought is given to the bad
effects of technological development; and the "work
ethic" in the negative forms it takes in our society
means that, for example, a nine-to-five job helping to
produce nerve gas is valued more highly than the
unpaid work of a child-minder
Clearly there is
something wrong with a society which has its values in
such a mess
Only a society organised according to
spiritual rather than material values can offer a real
alternative.
We live in a society where the values of quantitative,
material growth hold sway over the values of qualitative,
personal growth
We want a basic change of direction:
away from consumerist values towards a society where
the values of nurturing, caring, sharing, simplicity and
respect for nature are foremost.
We interpret Green philosophy by means of the
following seven principles which are at the root of all
our policies:
- The impact of society on the environment should
not be ecologically disruptive
'
- Conservation of resources is vital to a sustainable
society.
- All political, social and economic decisions should
be taken at the lowest effective level.
- Society should be guided by self-reliance and cooperation
at all levels.
- As caretakers of the Earth, we have the responsibility
to pass it on in a fit and healthy state.
- The need for world peace overrides national and
commercial interests.
- The poverty of two-thirds of the world's family
demands a redistribution of the world's resources.
As Greens, our main concern is to combat the
importance placed on growth in the quantity of goods
produced with a new approach which places the prime
emphasis on growth in the quality of life
We could sum
up the case against growth economics as follows:-
- Traditional methods of measurement do not
distinguish between good and bad forms of growth; an
increase in the production of e.g
armaments or
pornography would register as an increase in economic
growth

.
- The planet's resources - including minerals,
energy, and land-- place natural limits to growth.
- The philosophy and practice of economic growth
have led to devastating forms of pollution which
ultimately threaten life itself.
- Farming has more and more come to depend on
artificial fertilisers and machinery to the detriment of
the ecological balance found in traditional forms of
agriculture.
- Stable rural communities have been replaced by
large urban concentrations ~ such as Dublin in its
present form - with little sense of community
People
have lost a sense of belonging, of feeling "at home in the world"
Only a radical shift away from the values of
industrialism can restore for us a sense of belonging to
the community and the world
An end to the pursuit of
.quantitative economic growth does not mean a
downgrading of the quality of life
The emphasis on
work and productivity in industrial society has eroded
family life and the quality of life for individuals
A Green
world will place a much greater emphasis on personal
development, lifelong education, creativity and the
strengthening of community and family life.
In the following pages we shall try to show how our
environmental, economic, social and political problems
are interlinked and how they can be solved by a
rejection of the causes, causes which are rooted in the
system of large-scale industrial factory organisation.
ENVIRONMENT
The major global environmental problems are as
follows:
-Deforestation:
About 200,000 square kilometers (80,000 square miles)
of rainforest are cleared every year
This is an area
approximately the size of Great Britain
The main cause
of deforestation of tropical zones in Central America,
parts of the Amazon and Southeast Asia is the build-up
of the livestock and crop-production sector aimed at
export
Large areas are also being cleared for the
production of food products for the world market by
multinational corporations.
The second major reason for deforestation is
commercial wood production, which claims about 5
million hectares (12 million acres) of rainforest annually
For every ten trees cut down, only one new tree is
planted.
In order to exploit their mineral resources, to carry
out infrastructural, agricultural and forestry projects
Third World countries went into billions of dollars of
debt (debt which the banks were only too eager to help
them incur)
Because of the decline in world commodity
prices, they soon faced severe repayment problems.
Third World countries are forced to produce in order to
service their debts
Their forests, the tribal people who
live in them, and the world ecosystem and its population
suffer as a result
It is a generally ignored fact that
tropical rainforests, in which up to 50 per cent of all
known species of living organisms exist, can be
regenerated only with great difficulty - if at all.
There is also danger to the global climate
The
destruction of the forests can alter solar radiation,
cloud formation and rainfall
There may also be a Iink
between rainforest destruction and the projected
"Greenhouse Effect" - the heating of the earth's atmosphere
The rainforests convert carbon dioxide deriving from industrial emissions into biomass and the production of oxygen
Clearly, the problem of deforestation is one of appalling magnitude.

set an example by refusing to use wood and its products
from tropical forests in state structures, furnishings etc.
Greenhouse Effect
The burning of biomass in the form of coal and oil
releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (C02)
It
takes a long time to convert CO2 back into plant tissue
and for it to dissolve in the oceans
The result is that
CO2 is building up steadily in the earth's atmosphere.
CO2 dominates the thermal balance of the atmosphere,
which determines the temperature of the earth's surface,
where the winds blow, and the amount of rain or snow
they can carry
The more CO2 builds up in the
atmosphere, the more radiant heat from the earth's
surface is absorbed to be radiated back to the surface:
the "Greenhouse Effect"
It is believed that this will
cause a rise in average global temperature, change the
seasons and raise sea level, interfere with food
production, and produce massive flooding and extreme
weather conditions.
While not all scientists are agreed as to the threat of
the "Greenhouse Effect" there is sufficient informed
concern for us to be very worried indeed
In order to
slow down the process of climatic change we must
convert the excess CO2 back into biomass by growing
trees
At the same time we must reduce our levels of
consumption in order to reduce the effects of industrial
emissions.
Those who defend the excesses of the industrial
system say that nuclear fission is the only alternative to
the use of coal and oil
This may well be the case if one
accepts the priorities of industrialism: that "more and
bigger" is what is needed
On the contrary, we argue for
a return to a simpler, more natural lifestyle
This would
include a switch to renewable energy sources, an
emphasis on conservation, and an end to nuclear
power production, giving present technologies at least.
Regarding nuclear fusion, it is interesting that the same
arguments are being made for this as were made for
fission several decades ago
While we do not at this
time reject the use of fusion we believe that serious
consideration must be given not only to its ecological
effects but also to the effects on society of the use of
advanced technology as the primary producer of energy.
If this leads to control by a technocratic elite with
totalitarian powers the cure may be worse than the
disease
'
Acid Rain
Polluting gases like sulphur dioxide (S02) and nitrogen
oxides (NOx) make rain more acid than it naturally is.
Much of the acidity in rain comes from S02 emissions
from power stations, though this can be reduced by
fitting 'flue gas desulphurisation' equipment to
chimneys.
Industry, power stations and vehicle exhausts also
contribute to acid rain through emission of nitrogen
compounds
In 1985, 52% of trees in German forests
showed damage from acid rain
Acid rain contributes
to soil acidification, releases harmful chemicals in the
soil, damages trees, kills fish and insects and thus the
animals that feed on them, harms buildings, and can
also harm humans through water pollution.
The remedy for this problem is the fitting of
appropriate equipment to power stations that contribute
to this problem, the use of alternative and non-polluting
energy sources in production, and curbs on the use of
private transport.
The following are some of the major Irish
environmental concerns:
Pollution
In recent years problems of air, soil and water pollution
have been highlighted in Ireland
This organisation
played a major role in bringing these problems to
public attention, particularly through the Environmental
Emergency Conference which we organised in 1987.
We see three main areas of pollution - Domestic,
Agricultural and Industrial - and believe that in all
cases the costs of pollution control and of cleaning up
pollution must be borne by the polluters themselves.
Example of domestic pollution include refuse, fossil
fuel emissions (a major cause of the deadly smog
problem in Dublin) and car exhausts
In agriculture, .
synthetic fertilisers, pesticides, and slurry from intensive
animal farming are the chief offenders
Industrial
pollution takes many forms, of which toxic waste
dumping, emissions into rivers and the air, and the
noise and fumes produced by road haulage are the
most obvious
(Moneypoint on full load has resulted in
a 50% increase in S02 emissions from this country).
In the long term the above problems would be dealt
with by: smaller-scale disposal of domestic refuse;
reduction of organic waste through reduction in the
use of packaging and biodegradable material; the use
of non-polluting forms of heating and heat-conservation
(e.g
CHP-Combined Heat and Power) as well as the
generation of heat from renewable sources such as
solar energy, wind power, hydroelectric systems etc.; a
much greater reliance on bicycles and public transport;
a return to small-scale, labour-intensive, organic
farming; the establishment of small-scale, local, non-toxic
industries
The transport of all but the most
urgent of raw materials would be by railway, canal or
sea
Getting rid of most road haulage would put an end
to a great deal of pollution
There would also be a return
to the use of natural, locally-found raw materials in
industry.
In the short term we propose radical changes in the
pollution laws in an attempt to tackle the dangerous
state of our present environment
This would be coupled
with a changed attitude to pollution and polluters.
Industry would be monitored carefully and breaking of
anti-pollution laws would be heavily penalised
We
advocate the setting up of an Environmental Unit
whose function would be to enforce a new
Environmental Protection Act
It would be able to
classify industries, firms or individuals as 'potential
polluters'
This category would have to apply for
operating licences which would be given only to those
using the best available pollution prevention technology.
The Act would insist that operators of industrial and
agricultural plants disclose their production processes
when called on to do so by local bodies.
We also call for:
-An Environmental Levy on industry to pay for
environmental research.
-Immediate availability of natural gas for cars and
the urgent phasing out of all leaded fuels.
-Massive investment in public transport which would
have an immediate effect on urban pollution.
-The introduction of smoke-free zones in urban
areas and the promotion of smokeless fuels.
-The recycling of waste materials wherever possible.
-An immediate ban on all dangerous and untested
pesticides.
-Organic farming methods which would help phase
out the use of artificial fertilisers.
-The release of all pollution reports by state bodies
and public access to the associated files.
-The display of all emergency disaster plans.
-An embargo on new toxic industries and the
immediate closure of existing chronically polluting
plants.
-The ending of all grants and subsidies being paid to
those found polluting the environment.
-An end to the dumping of toxic waste, We insist that
all hazardous materials be detoxified before disposal at
the expense of the originator.
We are not willing to accept the concepts of
'acceptable risks' or 'safe levels of exposure' in dealing
with the effects of pollution and health hazards on
people
We look for the implementation of the
'precautionary principle'
In other words, 'if you're not
sure about the consequences, don't dump or pump.'
Our environmental problems cannot be viewed in
isolation from our economic problems
High levels of
taxation and low social welfare levels result from the
pressure to repay debts incurred through reckless
government borrowing
At the same time an antiquated
social welfare system results in the well-known 'poverty
trap', Our economic problems are made worse by
outdated and bureaucratic methods of wealth collection
which inhibit economic enterprise
One result of the
above is a very tangible one;,poor people cannot afford
to buy smokeless fuel, so the smog problem in Dublin
continues unabated
Perhaps if the well-off continue to
suffer from the smog problem long enough something
will be done to tackle the underlying economic causes.
Since they control the economy and the media (which
define our problems) it will hardly be done otherwise.
Another symptom of the excesses of the industrial
system is the desire for 'jobs' at any cost even when
job-creation means more pollution, as it frequently
does in the realms of "agribusiness", pharmaceutical
and chemical industries and others
We do not see how
anyone could achieve true work-satisfaction through a
harmful and polluting job
The way to tackle poverty is
through changing the method of wealth-distribution so
that people receive a substantial portion of their income
through national dividend or guaranteed basic income
- a basic sum paid to each citizen as of right every
week
This would leave them free to earn additional
income through individual and cooperative enterprise,
rather than relying on multi-nationals or the state to
provide them with employment.
The Nuclear Problem
We look for: 
- The closing of Sellafield to be pursued through the Euratom Treaty and  cessation of the construction of THORP' (Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant) on the same site; 
- the cessation of the discharged radioactive waste from Sellafield into the
Irish Sea; 
- an open-ended ban, to replace the present
moratorium on the dumping of radioactive waste at
sea; 
- much-intensified research on methods for the
safe disposal of the waste accummuIated to date
throughout the world; 
- the phasing-out of nuclear power production, on a time-scale laid down and
enforced by the U.N.;
- an immediate end to the foisting of nuclear power plants on Third World
countries; 
- a phased transfer of resources to research
into, and production of, means of generating power
from renewable sources of energy; 
- rigid control of radioisotopes used for medical or other research
We
also look for the prohibition from Irish air/sea space of
any craft which are nuclear-powered, carry nuclear
weapons or refuse inspection.
We call for the passing of a Nuclear Free Zone Act by
Ireland as a matter of urgency.
Urban Conservation
The quality of life is being eroded in most Irish cities
and towns
Dublin has been particularly badly hit in this
regard
The Green Party is seeking the following changes
on the way towards positive urban conservation and
'urban renewal:
There should be an immediate move away from the
disastrous strategy of the early 1960s which saw inner
city communities uprooted and re-housed in new,
often faceless and under-serviced suburban
environments
The population of Dublin's inner city
(i.e
between the two canals) has been halved in twenty
five years as a result of this policy
The first step in
getting people back into the city is to accept that
mistakes were made and to begin to undo the social
and physical damage which the inner city has
experienced.
-The scandal of land and property speculation must
be highlighted and then eradicated
It has brought to
our cities some appallingly ugly developments; it has
made many speculators wealthy overnight; it has left
Dublin in particular scarred with derelict and dilapidated
buildings.
-Planning must aim to retain the character of local
environments through the retention of what is
worthwhile in the old buildings and streets, while at the
same time encouraging integration in the designing of
new buildings
Financial and advisory assistance should
be provided for renovation and conservational
improvements to existing property, particularly in the
badly run-down areas of our inner cities
Cities like
Galway and Kilkenny have shown what enlightened,
urban planning can achieve
'
-The interests of local communities must no longer
be ignored in the creation of Development Plans for our
cities
The dismissive attitude the County Councils,
City Corporations and Government Ministers have
shown to the wishes and needs of local communities
is a scandal.
-Without an efficient and inexpensive public transport
system the car lobby will continue to expand and more
unnecessary roads to cater for the extra volume of
traffic will be built
Through effective barring of cars
from many city centre areas, together with a greatly
increased and much cheaper public transport system, the cities will function properly
There will be less
noise, less chance of road accidents, less pollution,
less stress
It needs an imaginative plan but is entirely
feasible and is the most sensible solution to the traffic
chaos which reigns at the moment in our cities
The
European move is away from traffic-congested cities
- this is one area where the example of Europe should
be followed.
-Existing local authorities must be given the power
to work towards urban conservation
New local
authorities should be set up to work with local
communities in other areas, helping to achieve this
goal
The Green Party advocates the making of decisions
at the lowest practicable level
This would ensure that
local communities have an effective input into decision-making.
-Education should play a key role in making people
aware of their environment and how it can be improved.
Education in schools and universities should strive to
emphasise the value of aesthetically-pleasing buildings
and environments.
-The movement of heavy loads and articulated
vehicles within urban boundaries must be strongly
controlled as regards the nature of the load, the weight,
the routes, the speeds and the times.
-Buildings and streetscapes of historical and
aesthetic importance which are placed in jeopardy by
Government and/or developers' plans must be
highlighted and those plans stopped
We propose the
demolition of the worse examples of modern
architectural barbarism (this would help to provide
satisfying and useful employment)
At the same time, all efforts must be made to preserve and if practicable
reconstruct our urban architectural heritage.
Rural Architecture
Ireland has been brought to international shame through
the destruction and dereliction of many fine old country
houses
It should be remembered that these involved
the work of Irish builders, architects and craftspersons
and are part of our national heritage
At the same time
the 'bungalow blight' continues' apace spoiling the
countryside for visitor and native alike.
We propose that imaginative use be made of existing
country houses of architectural and historical value
through social employment schemes focussed on
renovating them as community centres, art and craft
centres, educational and residential centres etc., under
community control
The potential of restored country
houses as hotels and as sources of income from
tourists is great and should be fully exploited
Planning
laws regarding the construction of private houses in
the countryside should be much more stringent and
rigorously enforced
Architects and publishers have
the responsibility to provide designs in accordance
with the Irish native tradition.
Conclusion
The above sets out the general environmental problems
of our nation and how they might be addressed
In the
following sections we shall show how misguided
agricultural and economic policies are contributing to
our environmental problems in specific ways; and
most importantly, how this situation can be changed
through a radically different approach.
ECONOMY
In the following section we shall deal with economic
matters under the headings: Agriculture; Resources;
Energy; Industry and Industrial Relations; Work; Banks,
Finance and National Debt; Alternative Taxation; Basic
Income; E.C./1992.
Agriculture
While overall productivity and income in the agricultural
sector is rising, 75 per cent of farmers are earning the
equivalent of or less than the average industrial wage,
and one third of these are living below the poverty line.
There are roughly 100,000 farm-unitsin the Republic,
little over half as many as there were in 1973
In 50
years time, there may be only l0,000 farm-unit remaining
The ongoing rationalisation brought about by
steadily falling profit margins, is concentrating wealth
in the hands of a few, while the traditional family farm
seems doomed to extinction.
Environmentally, the outlook is bleak with the
increasing application of chemical fertilisers, pesticides
etc: the continuing destruction of hedgerows to facilitate
large machinery, a massive increase in the land given
over to pine afforestation and many more factors
which tend to seriously pollute the local environment.
Already river pollution has become commonplace
In
the future, our countryside threatens to become sterile
and devoid of wildlife
Ultimately our ground water is
likely to become contaminated as is already happening
elsewhere.
The quality of food has seriously deteriorated since
we joined the EEC in 1973 and if present policies
continue, so will this trend
Further standardisation,
increasing levels of chemical residues in fruit and an
ongoing deterioration in the health of animals in factory
farms will further reduce the quality of food products.
A factor which may be expected to intensify all of the
above trends is the introduction of genetic engineering
into agriculture
Moreover, the release of genetically
manipulated organisms into the environment poses an
incalculable risk.
The only beneficiaries of the above developments
are big business interests, industry and large farmers.
We advocate the abolition of the CAP (Common
Agricultural Policy) and its replacement by a system of
grants to small and medium sized farms for producing
high quality food by ecologically sound methods.
Demand would once again determine what is to be
produced
Such a system would cost only a fraction of
what the CAP is costing.
Organic and bio-dynamic methods of farming should
be actively promoted - as well as being labour intensive
and ecologically sound, there is a massive
export potential for food produced by such methods.
Research in other countries indicates that such a
change is economically and technically feasible, but it
will require a transformation in university agricultural
departments towards the study and promotion of more
natural methods of farming.
In common with Green parties in other EC countries,
we believe that livestock numbers should be limited to
what the individual farm-unit can itself support
This
would prevent surplus production (I.e
food mountains
etc.) in the EC which could not come about were it not
for the massive imports of animal foodstuff, much of it
from Third World countries.
We believe that the State should play an active role
in facilitating landless people who wish to enter
agriculture, through the provision of credit on favourable
terms and by providing training in ecologically sound
methods of agriculture and horticulture
The equitable
distribution of land should be a matter of concern for
society as a whole.
We believe that planning should take place for the
main part at regional level
From the points of view of
farmer, consumer and environment a large degree of
self-sufficiency at local level is essential, Already much
damage has been done but this can be reversed.
The fate of the family farm and of the ecology of the
countryside are interlinked - labour-intensive and
small scale production structures are essential for
ecology
As consumers, taxpayers and as tourists, the
urban population has a vested interest in the survival of
the family farm
In global terms, ecologically sound
agriculture is essential for the long-term solution to the
problems of hunger and the threat to the global
environment
In countries such as West Germany, the
above problems have led to a' rainbow coalition' between
farmers, consumers, environmentalists, Third World
solidarity organisations and animal rights groups in
favour of ecologically sound agriculture
We look
forward to similar developments in Ireland (including
perhaps large numbers of students, unemployed, and
people tired of the urban rat-race who wish to work at
farming).
Because it depends on high energy inputs from
fossil fuel sources, our agricultural system is
unsustainable
We therefore need to move quickly to a
system of working with nature rather than using the
soil simply 'to enable the plant to stand up' 
As recent
events have shown, factory farming leads to the spread
of disease among the animals and birds and tends to
entail a high dosage of drugs - besides, of course,
frequently involving cruelty to the animals themselves.
All of these systems involve taking foodstuff which can
be used for human consumption and feeding it to
animals
This is inefficient from a protein and an energy
balance point of view, and robs the people of the Third
World of food which should be theirs
.
We regard salmon farming as another form of
factory farming
It involves keeping migratory fish in a .
cage, causing them stress which can lead to outbreaks
of disease
We are also concerned with the chemicals
used in salmon farming and the risks to the wild fish
from fish which escape from farms
We therefore want
a ban on any further development of salmon farming.
We are alarmed at the spread of monoculture sitka
spruce plantings, a development which has been made
possible by ill-advised tax incentives
Sitka spruce is of
very low value
Consequently, very little labour can be
afforded in its cultivation and harvest, and in Scotland
forestry of this type has actually destroyed communities.
Monoculture increases the risk of disease and pests.
We would encourage the planting of broadleaf trees
instead
We are using vast areas of peatland which is
more valuable as a fuel source if it is to be productive
at all.
In conclusion, for a wide range of reasons we
advocate a return to a simpler, more natural, less
damaging agricultural system in which people will
once more live a life in accordance with nature rather
than exploiting nature for private greed, an exploitation
which will inevitably turn on us all - perhaps sooner
rather than later.
Resources
The earth's resources are not our property, to use or
squander as we wish
Instead,we hold them in trust for
future generations
We therefore have no right to build
our economy around the use of oil and consume it at
such a rate that all known and anticipated reserves will
be exhausted within fifty years
The Greens believe that
oil and other fossil fuels should be taxed heavily to
stimulate the development of renewable sources of
energy, based on tides, wind, solar and geothermal
power
A rapid switch to these sources is necessary in
any case to prevent the drastic climatic changes and
the rise in the sea level as a result of the projected
"Greenhouse Effect"
Cheap energy from fossil fuels
has distorted every area of human life
It has made
transport easy and inexpensive, and so allowed the
growth of massive manufacturing businesses, drawing
their resources from all over the globe and distributing
their product internationally
The growth of these
organisations has had the following effects:
- Multinational companies have enormous economic
power, often greater than individual governments
As
a result, individual employees or members of the
public count for very little
Moreover, these firms have
demanded the construction of free-trade areas and
customs unions, so that they may distribute their
product even more widely
However, the effects of this
have been to accelerate the concentration of economic
power in their hands and to take political power further
from ordinary people, as the political unit grows.
- Massive companies entail massive waste,
particularly in transport, advertising and packaging.
Every study shows that they use capital and resources
less efficiently than smaller firms
Since they finance
most research, they have developed technologies which
suit them.
The Greens believe that decisions should be made
and things should be done on the smallest scale or the
lowest level possible
This means that communities
should aim to produce as much of their own
requirements for themselves as possible from their
own resources and that they should have political
power over those areas which affect them most closely.
Industry and Industrial Relations
The economic policies pursued by successive
governments both of Left and Right have sprung from
certain beliefs that grew out of the Industrial evolution.
These beliefs were:
- That nature was there to be conquered and controlled
and that we were masters of this planet and not
stewards
Therefore, we are not accountable for our
use (or abuse) of natural resources
This mind-set
must be related to the dominance of 'masculine' values
and the repression of 'feminine' values)n society.
-That all human problems could be solved by
technological 'progress'.
-That anything of a social nature which could not be
measured was of no significance
This meant that
human needs, e.g
for self-expression were regarded
as unimportant because they could not be quantified.
The above ideas have been responsible for whole
populations being brainwashed
into accepting' the
present state of things as normal.
We would encourage small-scale industry with low
capital investment; adapting technology to a more
human scale; moving towards greater self-sufficiency
with a greater use being made of local raw materials
and renewable resources; encouraging skilled work
requiring creativity and imagination; craft industries;
self-employment; trade associations to carry out
research and development for the self-employed and
small businesses; worker cooperatives; maintenance,
repair and recycling work including energy
conservation; social and community work including
work in the arts, sciences and voluntary associations.
We reject both the State and the market as the recipe
for economic success
While we see a role for long term
economic planning we believe that economic
decision-making should take place wherever possible
at local community level and at worker level (in the
context of worker-owned and worker-managed
enterprises)
Central decision-making in economic and
other matters should take place only in cases where
local decision-making is not practicable
While the
market has a role to play, the profit-motive must be
mitigated by environmental, social, ethical and aesthetic
factors
This will develop best in the context of a 'third
sector' of worker-cooperatives, aided by a developing
ecological and cooperative consciousness.
At present workers have no say on such basic issues
as: products; raising capital; investment; operation of
plant and office
They are unable to remove bad
management from office or to decide when an industry
should close
We propose the empowerment of workers
in such spheres as: raising capital; allocating profit;
determining investments in plant and machinery;
arranging job assignments, rotations and
responsibilities; choosing type of produce, services,
markets and prices; organising research and
development; setting wages, salaries, and fringe
benefits; hiring and training new workers; creating job
security and layoff standards; setting work standards
and work rates; establishing safety rules and standards;
overseeing physical working conditions.
Industrial capitalism has failed in the equitable
redistribution of wealth and work
Industrial socialism
has failed to manage the complexities of a modern
economy either in production or in distribution
Both
have failed in the crucial area of environmental
protection
Only a Green economy, characterised by
grass-roots participation and stringent environmental
controls, can provide a real alternative.
We favour the breaking-down of hierarchical,
managerial structures wherever practicable in the
workplace
We also favour the abolition of the extreme
forms of division of labour which dehumanise the
work-process: in particular the 'production-line' system.
Workers should, as far as possible, have the chance to
perform fulfilling work, in a humane and cooperative
environment, with maximum personal input into the
managerial, process, and producing sociaIIy and
ecologically desirable goods.
Semi-state operating companies could be reconstituted as workers' co-ops
Most of the existing
semi-state companies could be broken up into smaller
decentralised units
Large co-ops and all co-ops in a
monopoly situation would have, at least, equal
representation by the community.
Traditional companies could be transformed into
co-ops by:
- provisions for worker representation on boards
of directors;
- legislation enabling workers to acquire a slice of
the equity each year so that eventually they own the
business;
- tax and credit arrangements favouring co-ops
over traditional businesses.
Guaranteed basic income paid to each citizen would
inhibit any tendency for co-ops to revert to a traditional
capitalist structure because of financial pressure on
members.
We reject the state socialist alternative to capitalism
since it is undemocratic (a bureaucratic and technocratic
elite inevitably develops); inefficient (as shown by
shortages and low productivity); and ecologically
undesirable (because the state controls the economy,
environmental activism is seen as treasonable)
It also
helps to shore up industrial capitalism, since it is such
an obviously unattractive alternative.
Work
We would define 'good work' as work which involves
a stretching of human powers and development of
human potential; freedom from coercion (economic
and otherwise); a sense of the worth of the activity both
to the worker her/himself and to society and the eco-system
as a whole; a high degree of individual and
mutual involvement in decision-making.
What we need to aim for, therefore, is an organisation
of work which will provide maximum human fulfilment
while avoiding the pitfalls of both the capitalist and
state socialist systems.
For a variety of social and technological reasons, full
employment in the traditional sense is not possible.
(See Gorz, Paths to Paradise: On the Liberation from
Work.) Nor is it desirable, since 'employment' in the
traditional sense is strictly limited in its capacity to give
full opportunity for human development
Full
employment for all adult human beings would be a social
and ecological nightmare.
In fact the 'work ethic' in its present form is a fairly
recent development, corresponding to the need of
industrial capitalism for a docile and obedient workforce.
We argue that the road to human liberation is to
loosen the work/income connection through guaranteed
basic income rather than through pie-in-the-sky
proposals for full employment
The only truly civilised
society is one freed from the necessity to engage in
forced labour
(In fact, the decline of the industrial work
ethic and its structures could well lead to an increase
in truly satisfying human work - the reasons for this
will become clear as we go on).
The production of goods is the result not only of
human labour but of resources including the sun which
belong to no-one
It is also the result of machines
deriving from technological development, a part of our
common human culture
What we urgently need are
mechanisms to distribute the resources produced
fairly to everyone, in non-bureaucratic ways which
respect the right of human labour to a fair reward at the
same time
The capitalist method of wealth-distribution
- based on growth economics and the trickle-down
theory - is inadequate and ecologically harmful
The
state socialist method is unwieldy and also ecologically
harmful
The social democratic or welfare state system
combines - as in Ireland - the insecurity of capitalism
with the bureaucracy of socialism without the benefits·
of either.
One half of a Green work platform ,therefore, involves
means to distribute wealth which would provide a
basis on which people could have
a 
- considerable portion of free time and 
- the means to use it for self-development
in terms of physical, aesthetic and
intellectual culture
Of course, guaranteed income would
be only the basis of such development and would not
of itself ensure it
The transformation from mass
culture to a higher form of culture would be a long,
difficult but essential process
We foresee the situation
where education, for example, would become a lifetime
process rather than being confined to the first couple
of decades of a person's life.
When we propose opening a space for freedom and
human self-development, we certainly do not look for
an extension of 'leisure' in the sense in which it is
known in industrial society
Rather, we seek the
extension of free time as the basis - but only the basis
- on which a truly creative and vibrant human culture.
might emerge.
The other half of a work platform involves a switch
from capitalist and state control of industry to workers'
cooperatives and self-organised activity in the
'productive' sphere, or 'ownwork' in James Robertson's
terminology (see Future Work)
Robertson believes
that the normal pattern of working life in the future will
not be modelled on the typical pattern of (masculine)
full-time employment in industrialised societies, but
on a flexible mixture of part-time employment, family
work at home, and voluntary work mixed in perhaps
with spells of full-time employment
This pattern is one
that has been typical of women's working lives in
recent decades
It is clear that if we are to look to a
society characterised by increased leisure/own work
rather than by the traditional pattern of full-time
employment, radical social, political and economic
changes will be necessary.
The emphasis in a Green society would move towards
small family businesses, individual enterprises,
communal business, workers' cooperatives
We favour
reduced working-hours, work-sharing and a reduction
in working time; a transformation of the values attached
to production and consumption; worker democracy
and profit-sharing; ethical investment; alternative
trading systems for both goods and services (e.g.
LETS- Local Exchange Trading System- is a means
whereby skills are exchanged by a large number of
people on a credit-debit basis); community banks and'
credit unions; tax reforms that would discriminate
positively in favour of worker-owned and controlled
enterprises rather than the reverse as at present; and
voluntary social employment schemes
Emphasis
should be given to programmes of urban and rural
regeneration, as well as recycling, maintenance and
repair firms
There is considerable scope tor economic
enterprise in the development of socially-useful
products
Economic, social and political structures
should be decentralised to the greatest extent practicable
and characterised by maximum personal input and
involvement.
Everybody should have access to the means of
production where practicable - land, industrial space, educational skills, tools, finance etc
This would enable
people to become much more self-sufficient than at
present
We would encourage job-creation in the areas
of alternative energy, protection of the environment,
recycling, in the acceptable forms of new technology,
in health, housing and transport
The desirability of the
end product should always be borne in mind where
job-creation is concerned.
Part-time work should be improved in status
This
will not occur until part-time workers have the same
legal protection as full-time workers, and until jobs are
normally offered on a part-time basis
Jobs which offer
a low degree of personal fulfillment should normally be
done by more than one person
Because of the present
tax structure which penalises labour anyway, persons
willing to work shorter hours would not lose out
financially to a great extent even in the short term
In
the long term, guaranteed basic income would act as a
wage-subsidy to cushion the effect of reduced working
hours.
The development of small businesses is hampered
by bureaucratic regulations and unfair taxation
Present
VAT registration limits are so low that most one person
businesses would need to register, thus wasting
time for both the trader and the State
In the short term
we recommend that VAT registration limits are doubled
and in the long term we believe that VAT itself should
be reassessed as a method of taxation.
The bureaucratic and unfair forms of taxation PAYE
and PRSI - should be abolished in favour of
more appropriate tax methods which do not discourage
work.
Many people find they cannot apply for jobs because
of arbitrary age restrictions
This is a particular problem
for women who have spent years in the home rearing
children and wish to return to work
Age restrictions
have often been introduced because of pension scheme
requirements
It is unacceptable that actuaries should
dictate whether a person is employed or not
Pensions
should be freely transferable on changing jobs
Current
employment legislation should be amended to ban
discrimination on grounds of sex, age, race, class,
religion (or lack thereof).
It is unacceptable that work that is paid has much
more status than voluntary work
Persons working on
useless or even harmful occupations for pay receive
acceptance and praise in Industrial society while the
unemployed must seek special permission to work on
a voluntary unpaid basis for charitable societies
This
situation makes no sense whatever.
Trade unions perform a valuable service in protecting
their members rights
We believe that trade unions
should place greater emphasis on profit-sharing,
reduction in working hours, job-sharing
Trade unions
should also give greater weight to environmental
concerns
We are opposed to union practices which
limit access to certain forms of employment
Work
should be open to all those qualified and wining to
perform it.
We would encourage trade unions to become
involved in the organisation of production through
helping to set up co-ops
This would take them out of
the present adversarial situation to a positive
involvement in productive organisation
We also - in
the present situation - believe that trade unions
should take action against persons earning the national
average wage and over who take additional employment.
We are opposed to involuntary emigration but in
favour of labour-mobility and freedom to establish
residence in another country as a basic human right.
Banks, Finance and the National Debt
The financial realm is too important to be left to the
control of private banks which by their nature are
primarily motivated by profit
We would encourage the
development of a state credit agency and of credit
unions and community banks in preference to private
banks.
There is a difference between the national and the
international portion of the National Debt
The
international debt was pushed on the debtor nations
It
is a weapon of neo-colonialism which has had
catastrophic social and ecological effects on the Third
World: riots, social upheaval, starvation and ecological
destruction
In the Oxfam report For Richer for Poorer
John Clark points out that while the total of voluntary
aid from all Western countries to the developing world
in 1985 was $2.8 billion, the flow of resources from the
developing world to developed countries amounted to
$25 billion
In other words, for every dollar given by the
West in charity, the West's financial institutions took
out $9.
Debt-creation is a form of economic imperialism
wherein the Western financial institutions combine
with a home-grown elite to maintain the system of
economic domination.
In our own country, money which could be used to
alleviate poverty, to enhance health care and education
is being used to pay off the international banking
system
We propose that the possibility of Ireland's
participation in a debtors' cartel be explored, whereby
the debt could be renegotiated or, in the last resort,
repudiated.
With regard to the domestically-held portion of the
debt, repudiating this would be problematic, though
the rate paid on this could be reduced.
Alternative Taxation
The main problem is income tax
Anyone on PAYE is
taxed efficiently and harshly
The - partially or
completely - self-employed can be involved in the
black economy to the extent that only part of their
earnings get declared
Involvement in the 'black'
economy is often not because people are dishonest in
many cases, either the earnings seem too small to be
worth declaring or it seems just too complex to do so.
Nevertheless, the self-employed contribute far less
than their relative share in the economy would indicate.
Many people will be adopting the pattern of 'casual'
self-employment over the next few years, forcing the
authorities to choose between an unworkable system
of tax-collection and increasingly draconian methods
of enforcement which are unacceptable in a free society.
As there is no obvious means of reforming the system
to allow for this shift, income tax will therefore have to
be abolished and other taxes put in its place
This
should lead to a great decrease in bureaucracy and the
tendency of the 'accountancy mentality' to permeate
the whole of the society.
But there is a strong argument for abolishing income
tax quite apart from the problems of collection since it
discourages work-creation by making it prohibitively
expensive to employ people, and encourages the waste
of the earth's scarce resources by discouraging the use
of labour-intensive recycling industries.
The cost of all items is made up of four components:
labour, interest, rent and energy
In comparison with
other taxes, a tax on land has several advantages: it is
easy to establish who owns land and who, therefore,
should pay the tax
It is also fairly easy to determine the
value of a property at any time and, consequently, the
rate of tax which should be paid.
The taxation of energy is the key to achieving a
sustainable Green economy
Energy from fossil fuels
has all the characteristics required for a successful tax:
it is in such limited supply that we urgently want to
lessen its consumption and also comes from a few
suppliers, making collection easy.
Government income, therefore, should come mainly
from two basic taxes - one on energy, one on land.
Other taxes would also be needed, including taxes on
drink, tobacco and road usage in order to regulate
demand
We also suggest a tax on bank deposits and
on advertising
Any corporation tax should discriminate
positively in favour of worker co-ops.
We are living in a period in which energy is historically
cheap but this cannot last
Just like hard drugs, this
cheap energy has altered the metabolism of the world
economic system and there will be extremely unpleasant, withdrawal symptoms when the supply dries up
Almost
all the technology we have developed over the past
century has been based on the availability of cheap
energy and, when that energy disappears, the
technology is likely to be obsolete
The sensible course
for any nation is therefore to try to wean itself off the
drug now and establish a sustainable system not
dependent on cheap fossil fuels
The way to do this is
to tax fossil fuel energy so that its cost is equivalent to
that of energy from renewable resources
It would be
a shock to the system to do this suddenly but if the
target were set and achieved in stages over a 10-15
year period it would be possible.
How would the tax work? First, a calculation would
be made of the cost of energy in an Ireland which was
completely dependent on its own renewable sources
for its supply
The difference between this figure and
the current cost of fossil fuel would be taxed away by
a levy on production or imports of coal, oil, gas and
turf
But all imported goods have an energy content
It
would therefore be necessary to work out how much
fossil fuel went into their production (a relatively easy
thing to do) and impose an import duty accordingly.
Irish exporters would receive a rebate equal to the
amount of import duty so that they could continue to
trade abroad.
The immediate effect would be to encourage recycling
of things with a high energy content
Another effect
would be to encourage Irish producers to use low energy
methods of production and the technological
advances they made in this direction would open up a
new range of export possibilities
Water, tidal, wind,
solar, geothermal and biomass power sources would
all be developed and Ireland could establish a world
lead
(Price rises could be counterbalanced by the
removal of VAT, and would be offset by the removal of
income tax and by the payment of guaranteed basic
income).
Apart from energy tax the other major item in a
Green taxation recipe is land tax
Land tax, apart from
its economic benefits, would encourage people to
leave the city for the country, since it would encourage
the sale of under-utilised rural land
It would discourage
property speculation in cities - people could not leave
land derelict since they would have to pay tax at the full
rental value of the land
Land tax would help to abolish
the tax avoidance industry
It would also militate against
tax evasion, since it would be very difficult to evade
In
combination with energy and other taxes, it would free
the ordinary citizen from the burden of tax returns etc.,
and thus help to increase personal freedom.
While land tax would facilitate the Green ideal of
encouraging rural communities it would have to come
into being in combination with a number of provisions,
in order to minimise any tendency for productivity to
override ecological considerations:
- There would be no tax on areas of particular
ecological sensitivity
Zoning would protect e.g
wildlife
areas.
- The use of environmentally damaging chemicals
would be banned.
- There would be a certain minimum area which
would be tax-free or taxed at a reduced rate
In farming
areas this could include personal dwelling space.
- The over-use of machinery would be discouraged
through the provision of energy tax already discussed.
Land tax, used together with energy and other taxes
as a source of funding of guaranteed basic income, is
a means of ensuring that everyone shares in the wealth
of the lane by virtue of citizenship.
Guaranteed Basic Income
The argument that the state could not afford to pay a
basic income to everyone is false, since everyone
receives a subsistence al ready - none (or at least few)
are actually dying of starvation
The problem is that this
subsistence is paid in the -most illogical, counterproductive
and socially undesirable way imaginable.
The social welfare system - which presupposed
virtually full employment - is no longer appropriate.
The unemployed are paid to do nothing, and penalised
for working
They are expected to subsist on an amount
that is actually below subsistence, but not allowed to
top it up legally
This leads to evasion and dishonesty
as well as subordination
The system is riddled with
sexist assumptions, and hampers the trend to more
flexible labour relations
It victimises the handicapped,
and persons who wish to spend their time minding
their children or improving their education
Because of
the stigma, oppression, frustration and subordination
involved in 'unemployment' the pressure for 'jobcreation'
often results in pressure for socially and
ecologically undesirable forms of industrialisation to
'relieve unemployment'
The 'means testing involved
in the social welfare system enforces poverty for both
unemployed and pensioners.
Simply improving the rates of social security
payments leads to an 'envy factor' whereby those in
employment resist radical redistribution
This makes it
politically difficult or impossible.
The production system is using increasing amounts
of capital per unit of output, a development which tends
towards replacing workers by machinery, labour by
capital
State stimulation of investment leads in fact to
the destruction of jobs
Andre Gorz (Paths to Paradise)
points out that according to research in West Germany,
DM1,000 million invested in industrial- plant would
have brought about two million jobs from 1955-60
In
the period 1970-75 the same sum would have destroyed
500,000 jobs
Societies everywhere are organising the
reduction of socially necessary work time through
automation, but in ways which hide its reality
Waged
work can no longer remain the central activity in
people's lives, and any politics which denies this is a
fraud, Gorz argues
The basic aim of keeping full-time
work as the norm is to keep the relations of domination
based on the work ethic.
The introduction of guaranteed basic income (GBI)
would benefit those at the lowest income levels, since
it would provide them with a minimum income: there
would be fewer -badly paid, unpleasant jobs
The
consequence of GBI could well be an improvement in
working conditions/wages, or else it would force the
mechanisation of unpleasant work (no bad thing if a
person's needs are otherwise met)
GBI would greatly
improve the conditions of women by giving them
increased economic security and freedom, as well as
the choice whether to be child-minders or to work fulltime
or part-time (this is a choice it also affords men of
course)
It would involve - a tendency towards
equalisation between those in full-time employment on
the one hand and those in part-time employment on the
other
GBI would encourage small undertakings,
whether of an individual or a cooperative nature
The
basic income would function as a wage subsidy.
By weakening the work - income connection, a high
level of GBI would reduce the impetus - to socially
useless or environmentally harmful forms of
employment: social or moral considerations could be
taken more into account.
The case for nuclear and-armaments industries as
providers of 'jobs' would be seriously weakened since
jobs would be less important.
GBI ends the ludicrous 'means testing' which
enforces poverty for both unemployed and pensioners.
It provides artists and other creative people with the
subsistence necessary to create freely without economic
or other pressures on their work
It increases personal
freedom by getting the State off people's back and by
giving people the choice whether to take up paid
employment or be satisfied with a basic income
It
simultaneously releases people from the compulsion
to work while releasing those who wish to work from
the prohibition from working
It is thus doubly
emancipatory
It enlarges the realm of freedom for
individuals, and thus opens a space wherein people
can develop their creative, cultural, intellectual
capacities
Any negative effects deriving from people
leaving the labour force would be balanced by those
joining it
Many involved already in necessary work,
particularly of a more 'mental' level, are motivated by
factors such as job-satisfaction and peer-approval.
Fear of starvation is not a necessary or desirable basis
for a healthy economic system.
Ec/1992
The Irish economy is one of the most open economies
in the world, a fact which is often treated by native
commentators as a natural phenomenon instead of a
humanly-created one.
If you are exporting or are exposed to competition
from imports your prices have to be as keen as those
of the lowest-cost producer anywhere in the world if
you are to stay in business
Consequently, you have to
adopt essentially the same technology because the
cost of cleaning it up could make you uncompetitive
unless they are forced to do so too
You cannot afford
to pay wages any higher than theirs either, despite the
fact that it costs more to live in a country which freezes
each winter than it does to live in a tropical one
Nor can
you pay more taxes, even though your country is one
with a high social overhead and a tradition of caring for
the sick and the old - instead you must cut those
overheads, exactly as our government is doing now.
The free traders say quite openly that the only
businesses which can be expected to survive in a
country are those in which it has a comparative
advantage: in other words, those in which it uses
relatively less of the factors of production than its
rivals
They go on to argue that if every country makes
just those goods in which they have a comparative
advantage and they are traded for goods from other
lands, everybody benefits because the minimum of
resources will have been used to make everything the
world consumes.
The main flaw in their case is that efficiency of
resource use matters above all else
What is certain is
that if Ireland continues to take the free trade road we
will have some tourism, some forestry and some
mariculture but very little manufacturing
This is hardly
a basis for a balanced society
It is also a high-risk
strategy.
The only way to restore our freedom to build a
balanced, diverse economy is to abandon unfettered
free trade
We will obviously continue to import and
export because this gives us greater choice but our
overseas trade must be kept within much stricter
limits.
'1992' is being promoted with all the resources
available to the establishment who have prospered at
the expense of the bulk of the people of the country.
They do not even try to answer the questions such as:
has the EC helped business, employment, indebtedness
since we joined? Precisely why will the freeing-up of
national barriers to trade be beneficial to Irish industry?
But given their control of wealth and the media they do
not have to: the social consciousness is controlled
through advertising and the common 'consensus' of
the rich who stand to gain through the widening
markets for the multi-nationals, with their creation of
false and ecologically-damaging needs.
In fact, while not everything that has gone wrong
with the Irish economy can be attributed to the EC, it
would be' hard to deny that economically-speaking it
has had a largely negative effect and that '1992' will
intensify the process
Given the high transport costs
from Ireland to the European mainland, what logic
would there be in locating an industry in Ireland rather
than e.g
in Germany or Italy?
However, it would be wrong to deny that the EC has
had positive effects as well, though mostly not of an
economic nature
These can be summed up as the
areas of environmental legislation, culture (at least
potentially), and the freedom of movement and of
residence which the EC has opened up for the citizens
of its constituent countries
While there is a strong case
for controlling trade in the interests of national economic
health these controls should not extend to the free
movement of peoples since this is an unacceptable
limitation on human freedom and autonomy.
We therefore propose that Ireland should make
every effort to resist the incursions on her economic
and political autonomy which any deeper involvement
in the EC would entail.
WOMEN & SOCIETY
Our society is dominated by the 'masculine' phenomena
of technocracy, aggression, and sexist role-playing.
Only in a society in which 'feminine' values are given
their full role will it be possible for ecological values to
exist
We condemn the subtle and overt forms psychological,
verbal, institutional and behavioural which
sexism takes and we call for the liberation of
both men and women from the fetters of patriarchal
society
We call for adequate alternatives to be developed
to medical and technocratic control of reproduction.
We are particularly opposed to sexist advertising and
the pornography industry
We believe that women
should play an equal role with men at all levels of life
and we oppose all forms of male oppression of women.
The removal of this oppression and the conditioning of
both men and women that maintains it is the key to the
'Greening' of society
This Section is being reviewed by
the Women's Group.
Law
As a general principle we believe the function of laws to
be to protect individuals, animals and the environment
from harm
We are opposed to laws that unduly
constrain the freedom and autonomy of adult citizens
in their private lives
We believe that humane alternatives
'to the prison system should be fully explored and that
the legal system, needs to be made more equally
accessible to all strata of society
We call for a repeal of
Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, 1976.
Health
The individual's health is inextricably linked with the
health of the community and of the nation
Current
health care, with its emphasis on the treatment of
disease, rather than prevention, is not cost effective.
We advocate a health policy which encourages positive
health approaches in both the individual and the
economy
We advocate: '
- Control of chemicalisation of food and precise labelling
of all contents '
- Institution of education programmes for alcohol/drug
abuse in the school and workplace.
- Education of management, unions and work-force in
factors relevant to occupational health
- Selection of potential health professionals by a system
which places due value on humanitarian and
communicative qualities.
- Emphasis on the importance of nutrition and the
harmful effects of environmental pollution, in the
training of health professionals.
- Emphasis on personal responsibility for health and
the development of alternative, therapies.
- Creation of an awareness of the spiritual dimension of
human existence, and fostering of all avenues leading
to personal growth in the widest sense.
- Support by the community of pregnant women and
parents of new-born babies and of a more natural
approach to child birth.
- Arrangement of state and private insurance to provide
cover for alternative health care systems.
- A ban on harmful advertising, in particular of alcohol
and tobacco.
In the short-term, since much of our health care is
centralised in large over-stretched hospitals, we
advocate the following alternative to reverse the present
trend.
The Health Service should be divided into three levels
LEVEL 1:
- G.P
with Nurse Practitioners; 
- Polyclinics with multi-disciplinary teams from every
appropriate field e.g
midwives,chiropodists,
counsellors and social workers
Education is a major
concern here; and - Community Hospitals
These will
take referrals from clinics for minor procedures e.g.
glue ear and tonsillectomy.
The area of Community Care has suffered severe
cuts
The nature of intervention is almost entirely
crisis-orientated with little or no resources for any
meaningful preventive work.
LEVEL 2: Provincial Hospitals
These will service
referrals from Level 1 who require more expertise and
higher technology e.g
total hip replacements and
kidney dialysis.
LEVEL 3: High Tech Hospitals
These will work in ultra
specialist areas e.g
kidney transplants.
Education
If young children learn how to learn, they will be able to
take charge of their own education later on
They need
adult time: the time of people willing to listen and talk
with them
They need space to make their own choices
and follow them up.
Ideally schools should be 'facilities' where children
can make use of the skills of teachers and have access
to learning technology, rather than the educational
'factories' which mirror the actual factories of the
industrial system
We propose less time in school,
more learning outside school.
Every child at primary level should have a good idea
of what kinds of information there are and how to use
them selectively: nature, their surroundings, people
with different skills, books, libraries, cassette tapes,
videos, radio, television, computers, databanks ...
We believe that children have a right to adequate and
responsible sex education,
We believe that parents should be encouraged to
play a greater role in the impartation of basic skills,
including reading and writing, to children.
We believe that everyone should have full access to
education at all levels and in every sphere- scientific,
technological, and in the arts and humanities
In order
for this to come about there will need to be a massive
extension of educational facilities and ease of movement
between work and education rather than the rigid
structures that exist at present.
We are opposed to the over-emphasis on
examinations in education
GBI would facilitate access
by mature students to university, and would ease
financial problems for all students (this basic
subsistence could be 'topped up' by part-time or
,summer work)
In the long term the rigid distinction
between educational levels might be relaxed
We support
the extension of education to the public at large through
the use of the mass media and this is something that
could be greatly extended at the expense of much
media rubbish.
Culture
Just as the work in industrial society tends to be
alienated work (Le
it involves frustration not fulfillment)
so the leisure found in that society is alienated leisure.
Mass culture put out through the mass media is geared
towards entertainment rather than enlightenment
It
tends towards banality, shallowness, standardisation
and repetition, producing the expected rather than
challenge and stimulation
It works at the same time as
an escape from the workaday grind and as a means of
reinforcing the values of consumerism.
Thus, when we propose opening a space for freedom
and human self-development, we certainly do not look
for an extension of 'leisure' in the sense in which it is
known in industrial society
The values of a Green
culture would be opposed to the values of mass
culture
We are committed both to folk and to classical
culture and look for a massive extension of these in a
new society - at the expense of mass culture.
Language
Probably the major cultural disaster of Irish history has.
been the loss for the greater part of the population, of
the Irish language
We believe that in an ecological
society there would be an end to the forces that have
prevented the repossession by the whole population of
our rich and distinctive cultural heritage.
At the same time we recognise that the use of Irish,
since it tends to foster the self-confidence, amicable
co-operation and creativity of our people, will be in
itself an important agent in effecting the ecological
revolution we desire
For this reason, as well as out of
a sense of justice and of responsible stewardship, we
affirm the right of every person in Ireland to avail of
facilities for learning the Irish language.
We believe that everyone wishing to live her/his life
through the Irish language or to use it to any degree,
should be enabled to do so, especially in the domains
of public administration, broadcasting and education.
We demand further that Irish-speaking communities
should be protected from economic and linguistic
obliteration and allowed to manage their own affairs
politically

.
In line with our policy of partnership with the Third
World, knowledge of a neutral, easily-learned language
would allow communication between different
communities while avoiding the linguistic imperialism
consequent on the use of a stronger language
For this
reason, and because of the huge savings in costs of
translation etc
in international organisations, we
support the use of Esperanto as an easily-learned,
ideologically neutral and cost-effective means of
communication.
Discrimination
We oppose racism, sexism, ageism and sectarianism
and in particular, discrimination against travellers
We
demand respect for their lifestyle, language and culture
and the provision of adequate halting facilities
Irish
people cannot consistently condemn racism abroad
while continuing to practice it against the travelling
community at home.
Housing
It is natural for people to take the best care of things
they regard as their own
For this reason we support
home ownership, and we believe that it should be
encouraged by the formation of building cooperatives
and by the availability of low cost housing loans and of
building land at agricultural prices
Because of exorbitant
costs and rates of interest the present generation have .
'much less chance of owning their own homes than
their parents or grandparents had
This is a socially
harmful situation that will have to be changed if we
wish our people to have a real stake in the community.
Agricultural land itself, however, should not be used
for building, except as part of rural development plans
approved by the community for reasons other than
financial speculation
Where possible, old property
should be renovated rather than knocked down in the
interest of speculators; indeed, the making of profits
merely out of changing site values is inherently against
the interests of the community.
While a sufficient stock of council houses should be
kept for those needing permanent residence, it would
be in the interest of both decentralisation and the care
of the fabric if council houses were to be bought by the
sitting tenants.
Planning restrictions should be revised to allow
people to work from home, subject to neighbour
approval
There is nothing intrinsically wrong about a
suitable mix of shops, offices, light industry and houses,
and such a situation reduces commuting and adds to
a sense of community
Where possible, future housing
developments should contain a mix of differently priced
houses, to assist the dismantling of the class system.
Energy-conscious house designs and building
material should be promoted; and provision made
wherever possible for the communal use of labour-saving
devices.
Transport
We aim to reduce wasteful, and unnecessary mobility,
to promote the most ecological modes of transport and
to revitalise the railways as an alternative to road
construction.
Walking and cycling are the healthiest and most
ecological of all transport modes and should be
promoted if we are to remain a sane and civilised
society
Walking must be encouraged by the creation
of improved facilities in town and country, e.g.
pedestrianised zones, traffic-free urban areas and the
provision of stiles and rights of way across private
farmland in rural areas
Cycling should be encouraged
by the creation of permanent cycle-ways on all main
roads, better parking facilities, removal of VAT from
bicycles and spare parts, the building up of a strong
native bicycle industry.
Public transport must be greatly improved
We
urge:
- that responsibility for local public transport services
be transferred to local and municipal authorities;
- that the railways should be revitalised and expanded
for the transportation of goods and passengers;
- that free public transport should be available to
unemployed persons and their dependents.
In urban areas we propose that public transport
should be given priority over private, that the DART
service in Dublin be extended to other suburban areas,
bus services be improved by the creation of permanent
bus-lanes (in time these could be converted into
tramways or electrified light railways) more local and
circular routes and late night services be introduced
In
rural areas we propose that bus services be expanded
to provide regular connections between outlying country
areas, villages and the larger towns.
Since road construction involves enormous capital
investment, and since cars are energy-intensive,
environmentally damaging and dangerous, we
recommend that:
- no further large-scale road projects
be entered
upon and that investment be scaled down to whatever
is needed
to maintain our present road system in
reasonable repair;
- the use of vehicles with a long life be encouraged;
- present speed limits be rigidly enforced and steps
be taken to gradually reduce these limits in the years
ahead;
- car-sharing schemes be promoted and private
cars be excluded from urban centres;
- most heavy freight be transferred from the roads
to the revitalised railways;
- the size of lorries on public roads be drastically
reduced;
- heavy and articulated trucks be compelled to pay
the full costs of the damage they do to roads.
Finally, our rivers and canals are a wonderful resource
which have been neglected for many years
The time is
ripe for a serious' investigation of the social and
economic benefits to be derived from the use of these
waterways for transportation as well as for leisure
purposes.
POLITICS
Green politics works by consensus wherever possible
- that is, we reject the competitive, 'either/or' workings
of conventional politics and aim to achieve decisions
based' on broad agreement rather than the victory of
one interest group aver another
We also reject political
careerism, clientelism, profiteering, personality-cults
and the other elements that disgrace the Irish political
scene
Greens will practice rotation in office wherever
possible; consultation and participation at grass-roots
level; and the rechanneling of excess income of
candidates for ecological purposes.
In order to limit the influence of vested interests on
political life, we believe that stringent laws are needed,
limiting the size and mandating the publication of
donations to political parties.
Since we believe that the only real way to maintain
positive religious and other values in society is through
non-interference in the religious sphere by the state,
we support the principle of complete separation of
church and state.
Decentralisation
As we see it, decentralisation is about a community-based
way of life in which people would have real
control of the government of their own lives with an
increased self-reliance and self-determination
No
matter how brilliant, inspired and socially-aware
centralised government is, the ability to make correct
analysis and seek solutions to problems in a variety of
places is inevitably doomed to failure
Even where the
decisions are acceptable to the people, the resentment
felt locally at having these decisions imposed on them
from outside drastically reduces the effectiveness of
centralised control
The situation is worsened by the
centralisation of power in Brussels through legislation
such as the Single European Act, which will give people
even less say in their affairs.
Centralised systems are inherently undemocratic,
and even in our own small country Local Authorities
and· Health Boards have very little real power
As a
reaction to these problems, pressure groups are formed,
large portions of the electorate do not vote, laws are
openly flouted, and people extract what they can from
an alien system
Residents associations,
neighbourhood watch schemes, community radio,
credit unions and so on, all represent attempts to
circumvent the problem and create a real level of local
autonomy
We believe that these developments should
be built on, but more especially that statutory recognition
and authority must be granted to properly structured
community councils
it is only in such circumstances
that ordinary citizens will begin to become the rightful
arbiters of their own destiny.
Animal Policy
We are opposed to the abuse of animals whether in the
form of coursing, factory farming, vivisection, or in any
other way
Animals are especially prone to exploitation.
As they cannot defend themselves effectively, they are
employed, against their will, to support our wasteful,
unhealthy and increasingly hazardous way of life
The
Green Party seeks to end all forms of animal abuse by
our support for vegetarianism and alternatives to the
drug system of medicine.
Foreign Affairs
The Green Party believes that Ireland's neutrality
has been eroded over the years and now means little
more than military neutrality
Politically Ireland has
become increasingly tied to the western power block.
Our involvement in foreign policy co-operation in the
European Community, all of whose other members are
in NATO, has severely damaged our official neutrality.
Therefore we have lost much of our former good
- standing in the Third World and have been unable to
fulfill our potential role as a conciliator between the
developed and the non-developed countries.
We propose that Ireland's foreign policy should be
based on positive neutrality and constructive non-interference.
Where interference is deemed necessary,
as in the case of human rights abuses, this should be
done only through the United Nations.
We are concerned about the exploitative nature of
international trade particularly between developed and
undeveloped regions
This has lead to famine,
environmental disasters and the huge debt crisis
We
believe that trade should be conducted on a non-exploitative
and ecological basis
It is important to this
that the activities of multinational corporations be
controlled and that the international arms trade be
halted.
We oppose much of what is happening in the
European Community and believe that future European
co-operation should concentrate not on trade but on
intercultural co-operation, international environmental
problems and the monitoring of human rights
We are
eager to see such co-operation embody all of Europe
rather than just part of the West.
We condemn the repression of the Bahais of Iran,
and support the rights of the Nicaraguan, Palestinian
and Tibetan peoples to freedom from oppression
We
oppose apartheid and all forms of racism.
In present circumstances we believe it is very difficult
for Irish people charged with political offences to
receive a fair trial in Britain
Consequently we are
opposed to extradition from lreland to Britain for
persons charged with such offences.
Northern Ireland
The Northern Irish conflict arises out of the constitutional
status of Northern Ireland, a status that receives no
consent from a third of its population
It is a
constitutional crisis and it therefore requires a
constitutional adjustment for its resolution
Only when
that region acquires a constitutional status which
receives the consent of the overwhelming majority of
its citizens will normal politics begin.
The Green Party totally rejects the idea of coercing
northern unionists into a United Ireland; Likewise we
totally reject the current coercing of northern nationalists
into the United Kingdom
We advocate the
establishment of a Constitutional Conference to bring
about a democratic method of achieving a new
Constitution for the region based on the principle of
consensus and in particular we recommend the use of
the preferendum - or multiple choice referendum - to
this end.
We reject the use of force by all sides in this conflict,
We further call for the withdrawal of the British Army
from Northern Ireland and their replacement by a
neutral international, and as much as possible non-military,
peace-keeping presence.
Freedom of Information
Access to information is a neglected right
There should
be an enforceable right of citizen access to public
records, embracing central and local authorities, state sponsored
bodies and other bodies with public
functions
We believe that, in order to achieve this in a
comprehensive way, a Freedom of Information Act is
necessary
The terms of the Act should be as broadly based
as possible
It follows from this that the Act
would incorporate the repeal of Section 4 of the Official
Secrets Act 1963, which invested officialdom with
sweeping, and totally unacceptable, powers of non-disclosure
of information.
The new Act should also make it mandatory that all
meetings of public bodies be advertised, and that the
public should be entitled, and encouraged to attend.
It is a reflection of the power we have placed in the.
hands of others that we are calling for the establishment
of the right to freedom of information
If our right to
know proves to be an unachievable objective we should
be seriously concerned about the nature of our society.
