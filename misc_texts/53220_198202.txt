WORKERS UNITE
General Election Manifesto
The Workers' Party, Nov. 82.
Full Employment and The Economy
The Workers' Party stands alone in this election in offering a comprehensive and positive alternative to the identical hairshirt economic plans offered by the other parties.
Our plan "An End to the Crisis" published before the election was called, is based on the central principle that the massive economic challenge facing country can only be solved by determined resolve on the part of the government to raise national production in industry, agriculture, and the new technology sectors by means of a production plan. The spending plans produced by the other parties are born of the economics of despair, and are based on the indefensible proposal that we can deflate ourselves out of the recession.
No-one denies that tough action is needed to get us out of the economic mess produced by the free enterprise policies of the conservative parties.  But we say that the tough action must be directed towards the producing branch of the economy- to the private industrial sector, to the farmers, and by a broadly eased mobilisation of the state agencies and commercial state companies to cut the balance of payments and budgetary deficits by increasing exports and eliminating wasteful imports that can be produced just as cheaply at home.  The weak kneed and callous approach of taking tough measures only against the unemployed, the elderly, sick and the homeless would not be necessary if emphasis was on raising, national income rather then cutting spending.
The proposal of full employment by the end of the decade in our Economic Plan "An End to the Crisis" is not "pie in the sky" as some have asserted.  Full employment is the demand of our society.  It is a massive challenge. But if the will were there on the part  of the Government it could be achieved. We repeat our assertion that it is the duty of every political party that seeks to serve the people to formulate a realisable and realistic programme to create full employment.  It is not enough to talk, as the other parties do, of "creating more jobs", of "reducing unemployment", of "stabilising unemployment".  The aim of full employment must not be shirked.
Our first economic policy priority is thus the creation of full employment.  This means the creation of an additional 300,000 jobs at the minimum between now and 1991.  Our secondary priority is the maintenance of living standards, wages and incomes, and to provide for these maintained living standards for the annual increase in our population of 37,000 that will occur every year through the rest of this decade,
To meet those needs, national income must rise by an annual average of 5% for the rest of this decade.  As it happens this also is the target set in the Fianna Fail plan "The Way Forward" for the years up to 1987. If the Government had faith in their own proposal for a 5% growth rate it would be entirely possible to meet its aim of eliminating the budget deficit without leaving recourse to the harsh cutbacks proposed in the public expenditure chapters of the "Way Forward".  This central inconsistency in the "Way Forward" reveals a lack of faith on the part of the government in its own proposals on agriculture, industry, services and exports.  The Workers' Part shares this lack of faith because the "Way Forward" places all the onus for creating this growth on the historically inefficient and bloated private sector.  Implicitly Fianna Fail have also revealed this lack of faith in the private sector by proposing unnecessary real and cruel cutbacks in the public service.  As deputy Joe Sherlock said in the debate on the confidence motion in the Dail, the second part of the "Way Forward" was only the dressing to sell the first expenditure cutback, part.  In voting no confidence in the government it was entirely appropriate for The Workers' Party to express its lack of faith in a government that demonstrably had no faith in its own proposals to "solve" the economic crisis.
The production plan put forward in "An End to the Crisis" sets forth a "sticks and carrot" approach to prod the economy into increasing its output by 5% a year.  As part of our "stick" approach, we propose to trim back on the £2,500 million spent - annually by the state on the private sector so that the most economically productive sections of industry get the use of these public resources - a central element in the approach recommended in the Telesis report.
As part of a carrot approach for the private productive sector, we propose a taxation strategy which would provide an incentive to companies to increase their production and exports in line with sectoral planning targets by means of a flexible adjustment of corporation tax levels through depreciation allowances.  Depreciation allowances would be scaled back or eliminated for firms which failed to meet their targets, while they would be geared to provide both an enhanced return to the Exchequer and an incentive to companies which participated in the national production plan.
The direct approach of establishing new state companies in the producing sector, such as Technology Ireland Ltd., An Bord Taluntais, and the new State Timber Board, and the capitalisation oil existing semi-state companies such as the E.S.B., Aer Lingus and Bord Na Mona to enter new areas of the economy will,however, be the main central plank in the
production plan. The financing of this development plan would largely come in the 4 year "recovery phase" of our 9 year strategy in the form of foreign borrowing through the European Investment Bank and in the open market.
YOUTH
Plan to end the Crisis of Youth Unemployment
The full employment strategy contained in "An End to the Crisis" necessarily recognises that the creation of full employment must be a medium term objective, lasting years.  Full Employment, implying the creation of productive and socially useful employment opportunities for all by 1991 does not however meet the immediate needs of school leavers who will enter the adult world in the next three years, as well as the many thousands of young people presently unemployed.
To meet the immediate challenge of youth unemployment, we would implement a  programme, starting immediately, of equipping the presently unemployed youth population with the skills and education necessary to enable them to take up the job opportunities that under our plan would become available in substantially increasing numbers after the
mid 1980s.	This approach differs fundamentally from that of all	the other parties in that it occurs in the context of a plan.  At present the pitiful youth programmes now in existence or coming on stream are simply geared to keeping young people out of the official unemployment figures. What are are they being trained for ? - for a future of high skilled unemployment under the plans of the free enterprise parties as they move from temporary training programme to temporary training programme, and eventually, the dole? In the context of our detailed proposals for the development of a high technology "fourth sector" in "An End to the Crisis" major emphasis in our proposed special youth education and skills plan will be the provision of education to young people in all sectors of new technology, ranging from telematics,  to computers to information science. In line with the aims of our education policy the proposed special youth programme will go hand and hand with the aim of reorienting education to provide "for a population optimistic about industrialisation and urbanisation and motivated by the tremendous opportunities presented by developing technology this will be combined with the development of the social skills necessary for the participation of people in democratic decision making, increasingly vital in our complex modern society".
Consistent with our target, in "An end to the Crisis", of cutting unemployment by 5,000 a year in the initial years of our proposed "recovery plan", the special youth education and skills programme proposed would provide the following target number of training places:
		April 1984     12,000	
      	April 1985     45,000		
		April 1986     35,000
      	April 1987     20,000	
		
These places would be provided in a coordinated plan involving the 3rd level educational institutions, AnCo, the VECS, the semi-State bodies, the State research organisations.
The cost of this programme could be met, as is stated in "An End to the Crisis", out of the capital and property taxation proposals amounting to about £300 million that would be available from the implementation of the amendments to the 1982 Finance Bill proposed in the Dail by the 3 Workers' Party TDs, and in the "alternative budget" plan put forward in the February election by The Workers' Party.
SOCIAL WELFARE
At Present over £l,200 million or 14% of current Government expenditure goes on social welfare. This is only to be expected given our population structure and our high level of unemployment. At present there are 1,120,000 people/pensioners, unemployed, the sick and children dependent on social welfare payments.
If it is implemented expenditure on social welfare will be increased in real terms, the living standards of recipients protected and increased and jobs created for the unemployed.
The main developments in social welfare over the period of this plan will be:
- A major review of our social welfare system to guarantee all persons a Minimum Income.
- A real increase in the incomes of social welfare recipients, in particular, old age pensioners, widows, one parent families.
- Special measures, in the short-term, to help the long term unemployed while, at the same time, creating jobs for them.
- The introduction of a National Pension Plan.
- The extension of social insurance to cover the self-employed, so that farmers and other self-employed persons pay income related social insurance contributions.
- The elimination of all discrimination based on sex from our social welfare system.
- An independent Social Welfare Appeals System will be established.
State support for families with children has been falling steadily in real terms and it is the families with the largest number of children who hove lost out most.  Child tax allowances and children's allowances have been falling in real terms. For those in employment and in addition, through the social welfare and tax system, a Minimum Income for all persons will be of enormous benefit to these groups. In addition, a Child Benefit Scheme will be introduced giving a weekly allowance in respect of each child, in lieu of income child allowance and children's allowances.
HEALTH 
Introduction:
The Workers' Party is committed to the establishment of a National Health Service. This service would be free at the point of use and without discrimination. We are totally opposed to the present cutbacks.
A National Health Service can be introduced, while committing very little additional resources to the health services. 	All that is required is a reallocation of expenditure and a restructuring of the present service.  In Ireland, the Pharmaceutical and Medical professions have been allowed to serve their own interests.  They have not been compelled to serve the public interest as is now the case in most European countries.  Over the period of this plan the current level of expenditure will be maintained, in real terms, up to the end of 1986.  From 1986 to 1991 additional resources will be allocated to preventive medicine and to Community Services.  The aged need a much better Home Help Service - this means more care for a substantial number of people.
CRITICISM OF CURRENT POLICY:
Ireland, at present spends an unusually high percentage of its gross National Product on the Health services.  The paradox is that public expenditure of £900 million, over 7% of the GNP, provides very limited health care coverage, whilst a smaller proportion of UK Gross National Product provides 100 per cent coverage. The main reason is, of course, that we have an illness service rather than health service.
Over 50% of health expenditure goes on general hospitals. A high percentage of this goes to "Voluntary Hospitals" controlled by the Church and a variety of other interests.  Within the community health services, over 60% of expenditure goes on drugs.
Also the medical profession wants medical care, sold as a commodity on the market. In such a situation, there is more money in private medicine than in public medicine.  We should recall the statement of Jack Massey, Chairperson of Kentucky Fried Chicken, who resigned to become head of the Hospital Corporation of America. "The growth potential in hospitals is unlimited, its even better than Kentucky Fried Chicken".
Over the period of this plan, the stranglehold of doctors drug companies and voluntary and private hospitals on our health services will be broken and a National Health Service, established.
Development Plan:
Our present population structure, the piecemeal development of our health services, the competing demands for increased in funds, all  point to the need for a major re-evaluation and major change.  Without a radical rethink Ireland's health services face  a crisis.  Planning in the health services is crucial so that  the services may be developed rationally and efficiently.   Our  Development Plan for the Health Services will
- Reallocate resources from hospitals and drugs to preventative medicine, including community care and community services.
- Provide a complete divorce of public private systems - no private practice in Public Hospitals and no public subsidy to private hospitals.  Voluntary hospitals, 90% of whose funds comes at the moment from the taxpayer will be brought under public control.
- Provide full eligibility for health services for all citizens as follows:
- A free General Practitioner Service for the entire population will be phased in over the five year period i.e 1983 to 1988
- A free hospital service for the entire population will be phased in by 1988.
- Free medical services for all children under the age of 16 will be introduced by the end of 1984.
- A free dental care service for the entire population will be introduced by the end of  the 1988.  As an immediate priority, free dental care will be extended in 1983 to cover pregnant and nursing mothers.
- The cost of  a national health service without changes in the method of payments of doctors and consultants, would be explosive.  GP's will be paid on a capitation basis rather than on a fee-per-consultation basis.  Consultant specialists will be paid a salary than on a patient per stay basis.
- Part of the reallocation of resources to preventive medicine and community care will involve the introduction of a comprehensive family planning service under the Health Boards, proper child care facilities, a comprehensive health and safety at work programme and a national health education programme. 
HOUSING
Introduction:
The right to basic shelter is a fundamental right and, accordingly, access to housing must be, ensured on the basis of a persons housing need and not on their ability to pay. A national housing plan forms, therefore an integral part of our economic and social plan.
This country is facing a major housing crisis.
- There are at present 36,000 families on the waiting list for Local Authority Housing around the country.  This represents more than three families waiting for each local authority vacancy arising annually.
- There are 15,000 families living in unfit or overcrowded conditions.
- There are 3,000 families homeless.
- 30 per cent of old people living alone have none of the basic water amenities for their sole personal use and 10% have no electricity.
- The housing situation in the Dublin area is particularly serious.  There are at present almost 8,000 on the waiting lists of the Dublin Local Authorities. Annual vacancies including new dwellings) represent only one third of application.  In addition, the number of existing tenants seeking transfers is over 6,000; the vast majority of those are living in over-crowded conditions.
- Local Authorities should be required to cater for single people's housing needs.  At present this need is meet by private landlords who grossly exploit this section of community.
- First time house-buyers, particularly those on low incomes, face major difficulties. The average deposit incomes required on new houses has increased from 19 per cent of average industrial earnings in 1978 to over 30 per cent in 1981. Monthly repayments for mortgages on average priced new houses have increased from 38% per cent of average industrial earnings in 1978 to over 60 per cent in 1981.
If we are solve the above problems and to cater for the housing needs of our young population, then we need to build 260,000 houses between now and the end of the decade.
CURRENT HOUSING POLICY
Fianna Fail and the Coalition have organised housing policy to create enormous wealth for their backers in the Construction Industry, for land speculators, for their friends in the building societies, and to give huge subsidies to house-owners with large incomes.
The proportion of public capital expenditure devoted to Local Authority housing has declined dramatically at the expense of subsidies to the private sector.

Also Fianna Fail and the Coalition have reduced significantly in recent years the number of new houses being constructed by local authorities.

They also helped their friends in the Building Societies by giving them an interest subsidy of over £6 million in 1981. Also the various grants for first time buyers are immediately reflected in an increased price for new houses. For example in 1977, following the introduction of the £1,000 grant first time purchasers, the average prices of new houses increased by 19 per cent and by a further 29.2 per cent in 1978. In 1978 house prices increased nearly four times as fast as consumer prices and by more than twice the increases in adult earnings, whereas the increase in the previous four years was approximately equal to the average rise in adult earnings. At the same time Fianna Fail and the Coalition refuse to tackle the scandal of land speculation and to implement the Kenny Report.
We say that a state construction company, engaged in the percentage of construction that the state now finances about 87% would enable the state to reap the full gains of the taxpayers' money spent on the industry.
We say that the value of all re-zoned land should be frozen at its use value and should be acquired when needed by a compulsory purchase order.
The construction industry should be reorganised on the following lines:
- The state should make a continuous supply of sites available to the state construction company at their previous use value.
- Usurious interest rates should not be allowed to price homes off the market and add to the cost of industrial development.  This means public control of the financial institutions.
- Ultra modern building methods should be used by the state construction company.  This would put an end to "lumping", inferior standards of work and other rackets which are now the rule rather than the exception in the construction industry.  These modern building methods would reduce building costs by two-thirds.
TAXATION
The tax policy of the Workers' Party entails a shifting of the tax burden from the PAYE sector on the property speculators, the holders of wealth, farmers and the business sector who are not paying their fair share.
There is no scope whatever for a reduction of the overall levels of and, indeed, the overall tax yield must be increased.  It is more essential than ever that the tax system should re-formed so as to simplify it for the majority of taxpayers and to ensure that the tax burden is evenly shared.  The working people of Ireland will no longer tolerate the, present levels of tax evasion, tax avoidance, and the simple refusal to pay taxes by business sector, the speculators and the farmers.
The only scope for real increases in indirect taxes is by way of levying VAT on clothing, footwear and food.  This is totally unacceptable to The Workers' Party. Increases in indirect tax hit the lower income groups the hardest and these increases will be opposed by The Workers' Party in the future; we have successfully opposed them in the recent past.
The greatest part of VAT and Excise Duties is paid by the PAYE sector. We are opposed to any attempt to reduce direct by increasing indirect taxes.
TAX COMMISSION REPORT      
Some minor elements in the Tax Commission Report are to be welcomed but the "broad thrust" of the Commission Report is totally unacceptable to The Workers' Party. 
The demands of The Workers Party and of the Trade Union Movement are for a more equitable tax system where the tax burden is shifted from the PAYE sector on to the farmers, the self-employed, the business sector and the propertied classes.  The  Tax Commission's first report (on direct taxation) if implemented, would mean a reduction in overall business taxation, a massive reduction of over £400 Million in the employers' PRSI bill and no resource or wealth taxes. The progressive elements of the income tax system would be abandoned and replaced by a direct expenditure tax of dubious practicability.  The burden on the PAYE sector would be increased and not reduced under these proposals.  The Commission proposals fail miserably to redistribute the tax burden.
THE WORKERS' PARTY PROPOSALS
The Workers' Party proposals for taxation will be outlined fully in our document on taxation which will be published shortly.  Our proposals include the following:
Income Tax:
- Tax allowances to be replaced by tax credits.
- The tax exemption limits to be increased.
- The width of the 35% rate band must be widened substantially.
- Rates above 60% to be introduced.
- The tax relief for mortgage interest to be reformed so as to give the greatest benefits to the lower income groups.
- Tax not to be charged on short term social welfare benefits.
- All incomes, including income of the self-employed, to be taxed in the year in which it arises.
- All farmers to be included in the tax net.
- A resource tax to be introduced on agricultural land.
- PRSI we have already outlined our policy on PRSI in Dail Eireann.
CAPITAL/PROPERTY RELATED TAXES-
- A Wealth Tax to be re-introduced.
- The yield from Capital Gains Tax be increased by removing the indexation for inflation revisions.  
- The rates of Capital Acquisitions Tax (gifts and inheritances) be increased and the exemption thresholds reduced.
- A re-zoning tax to be introduced.
- A tax on all property other than a main residence.
COMPANY TAXATION
- Tax concessions to be related to output in the future.  
- The overall level of the Tax Yield from companies to be increased.
- Intensive tax audits of companies and self-employed to take place based on stratifies random sampling.  
- A major anti-evasion and anti-avoidance campaign to be mounted in the business sector.
- Penal rates of interest to be charged to ensure that the tax bills are paid when due.
- The tax provisions regarding banking end financial institutions to be amended to prevent abuse and to increase tax revenue.
EDUCATION
A progressive and developing urban industrial society requires an educated population, adaptable to change and properly equipped to cope with the demands of that society.
We need to re-orientate education to provide for a population optimistic about industrialisation and urbanisation and motivated by the tremendous opportunities presented by developing technology. Our system of  education must play a positive role in harnessing this technology to our social needs.
The current middle and upper class domination of secondary and third level education needs to be challenged and effective policies must be introduced to give an equitable share in educational opportunities to working class people.
The Workers' Party's plan for education will use a comprehensive approach, covering the period from pre-school and nursery through to adult education and also recognises that the future economic development needs skilled and trained people. Accordingly, we are committed to increasing expenditure on education in real terms.
EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN
- Expansion of pre-school and nursery education facilities under the control of the Primary sector.
- Priority for expenditure will be given to Primary level and junior cycle of Secondary level.
- An increase of over 3000 teachers at primary level and 4500 at Secondary level.
- Special educational allowances to enable working class children be educated beyond the minimum school leaving age.
- Positive discrimination to enable working class children participate in third level education.
- Additional resources for remedial education and declaration of educational priority areas.
- An overall plan for higher education, covering the NIHE's, universities, Regional Tech.Colleges, Colleges of Tech. and Teacher Training Colleges.
- Paid Educational Leave for workers.  Giving workers paid time off from work to attend training at any level, for general, social and civic education and Trade Union Education.
- Opposition to the introduction of fees for second level education.
- A comprehensive and free school transport system provided by CIE.
CONTROL OF EDUCATION
Over the period of the Educational Development Plan, the contradiction of public funding and private control of all schools will be ended and a democratic system of management will be introduced.  Most schools are currently denominational in ownership and management while the taxpayer, through the exchequer provides the bulk of the money. The reorientation of our educational system towards the need of a modern urban economy would prove impossible while leaving control in the hands of religious authorities.
CITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT
The domination of Irish politics by the farming vote has meant that the problems of our towns and cities have been neglected to the point where they now form yet another "crisis".  Cities in our culture have been devalued and the conservative parties have looked down on the capital city as "dirty Dublin".  Crocodile tears from the parties responsible for the crisis in our cities will not solve the problems.  Neither will a hundred Gregory deals.
Speculators and get rich quick merchants have been given a free hand by Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.  Labour's solution, as articulated by Justin Keating, is to get people out of the cities and back to the land.  The derelict sites which litter Dublin are fitting monuments to the greed of the speculators.  A good few thousand of the £200 million added to the value of land re-zoned in recent months will make its way into the election coffers of FF and FG whose councillors coalesced to throw out the County Council's planners recommendation against re-zoning.  The Workers' Party believes it is time all our towns and cities were made "speculator free zones".
The decline of Dublin, Cork, Waterford and other urban areas has resulted from the lack of social and economic planning in favour of the generation of private profits.  The recommendations of the NESC Report "Urbanisation: The Problems of Growth and Decay in Dublin" have been ignored by Fianna Fail and Coalition Governments along with the Kenny Report and the dozens of other studies which have highlighted the need for urgent action.
The Workers' Party demands fundamental changes in the approach of Government  to Dublin and the rest of urban Ireland.   Jobs, houses and a decent environment must be planned for and provided along with a network of social and community facilities and amenities.  The free play of market forces have no role to play in the development of out towns and cities.  To develop an urban environment geared to the needs of people who live and work there.   The profiteers and speculators must be removed to the sidelines or to Straffan House (which could become a refuge for redundant speculators outside the despeculatorised zone).
- JOBS
In Dublin and other urban regions the Workers' Party proposes the establishment of a Regional Industrial Development Office with representatives from the local authorities, Manpower, AnCO, the Trade Unions and other relevant bodies.  The office would work in close co-operation with the IDA.  Its task would be
- to establish the numbers and types of jobs required
- to identify where the jobs should be located
- to ensure that these jobs are created by public or private enterprise
The pollution free industrial projects outlined in our plans for the microelectronics industries are particularly suited for areas of high population.  The bias against Dublin and the East Coast generally in the IDA's incentive schemes must be removed immediately.
- DECENTRALISATION
For The Workers' Party decentralisation means that every large working class area in all our cities must have a Community Services Centre.  This Community Services Centre would be linked into a central computer headquarters so that all information would be easily accessible.  The services available in these C.S.Cs. would include the following
- Social Welfare.
- Taxation
- Manpower/AnCo. information.
- Car Tax and Insurance
- Housing Department
- ESB and Gas Office and Maintenance
- Health Centre
- Legal Aid Office.
For the conservative parties, decentralisation only means moving civil servants en bloc out of Dublin.  For The Workers' Party it means moving social services to where the people who use and need these services live.  We are talking about decentralisation of services to communities like, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Finglas and Crumlin, areas with populations the size of Limerick or Galway.  And the cost of this decentralisation would be a great deal less than hijacking a Government Department to a provincial town in order to copper-fasten a marginal seat by bringing new business to local shopkeepers, landlords and auctioneers.
The provision of a comprehensive range of services accessible to the local community would go some way towards eliminating the widespread practice of politicians acting as 'Go-fors' in order to convince constituents that their entitlements as citizens are really political favours.  Politicians would then have to contest elections on the basis of policies rather than looking for votes on the basis of favours or strokes.
- URBAN DEMOCRACY
At present working people have little or no say in the planning, administration or servicing of their Communities.  Any say that people have is expressed indirectly through public representatives (T.Ds. and councillors).  This is not enough.  The Workers' Party advocates a fundamental reorganisation of local government.. The essential feature of this reorganisation will involve.
- The establishment of a democratically elected Greater Regional Councils with overall responsibility for development in the region.  The Greater Regional Councils would be responsible for the drafting and implementation of a strategic plan or the region in conjunction with local District Council
- The establishment of a series of democratically elected Local District Councils throughout the region as a new tier of local government. These councils would have responsibility for local services
- LEAD FREE PETROL
Despite the well documented evidence of the damage caused by the disgracefully high lead content of petrol on sale in Ireland, The Workers' Party was only party to make lead free petrol an issue in the February Elections.  Since February the Party has continued its campaign on this vital issue both inside and outside the Dail. Proinsias de Rossa made some progress by persistent pressure on the Minister responsible for the oil industry, Albert Reynolds.  We are committed to continuing this campaign in the next Dail until, in the short term, the lead content of all petrol on sale in Ireland is reduced to the levels recommended by the EEC.  We will keep up the pressure until only lead free petrol is allowed on the Irish market . The health of children in urban areas, especially inner city communities, must be protected from the damage which lead causes.
- TRANSPORT
Transport policies affect the lives of every city dweller regardless of age or what part of the city or county they live in.  An efficient transport system would ensure that workers, their families and the goods they produce or require can travel easily and cheaply.  For this to happen there must be an integrated transport plan.
The smooth and safe movement of traffic however, must not be at the cost of irreparable damage to living conditions, destruction of amenities, or the further depopulation of Dublin's city centre.
This means facilitating, developing, and extending public transport as the most efficient mover of people.  It means, also positively discriminating in favour of the old, the young, the disabled and the less-well-off sections of our community - in other words 80% of the population.
CIE's Electric Rapid Rail proposals would provide Dublin City and county with a sound basis for a fast, efficient public transport system suitable to a modern city. It would have 47 stations with linking bus services, and over 200,000 employment places would be within a 10 minute walk of each station.
Because transport decisions affect all our lives, our work, our leisure, our safety and our health, we believe that the main responsibility for transport should be in the hands of a public body -the State owned C.I.E. Furthermore we want C.I.E. to be run by a management who see a future for public transport: not only as a social service, but also as a viable enterprise capable of diversifying into related
- AMENITIES FOR RECREATION
The amenities and recreational facilities available in most of our large urban centres are truly a tale of two cities.  The Upper Class and Stockbroker districts have acres of golf courses, clubs, parks, playing fields and sea-views.  Many working class communities have to settle for vandalised car parks, tarmac patches and chip shop space invaders. While City Councils have developed some excellent amenities, they have been seriously handicapped by a lack of resources and the class prejudices of their political masters.
Indoor and outdoor recreational facilities must be provided as a matter of urgency for those communities who have been deprived.  We will insist that the provision of amenities
will not be used as political handouts to be traded for votes as election time.  An Urban Amenities Plan is required laying down standards for all new and existing estates, coordinating the activities of the different agencies involved. (e.g. Parks Department and Board of Works), and ensuring the even development of amenities.  Local developments would be carried out in consultation with the community and with the involvement of voluntary organisations.  We reject the undemocratic measures envisaged for the implementation of the Haughey-Gregory deal.
Some of the money required for implementing an amenities plan could be raised from those who have profited most from the unplanned development of our cities.
The Workers' Party proposes an Urban Amenities Fund administered by a new Urban Amenities Section within the Department of the Environment.  The plan would be implemented in consultation with Greater Councils end District Councils.  The implementation of an Urban Amenities Plan is seen as a vital part of The Workers' Party proposals to reverse the process of suburban decay and neglect.  The majority of our people live in an urban environment.  The State has a duty to make that environment suitable to the needs of people rather than a source of profit for whizz kids and speculators.  
CULTURE
During the course of the next Dail, The Workers' Party will be raising the question of the funding of cultural activities We include under this heading, art, film, drama, recreation, indoor and outdoor leisure pursuits.
The absence of a coherent approach to the development and expansion of cultural activities and centres is one of the hallmarks of the lack of concern by the parties responsible for the quality of life in the Republic for the past sixty years.
The Workers' Party would hope to produce a comprehensive series of proposals affecting this vital aspect of life and geared to the needs of all age groups from the young to the retired citizens.
Policing
The problems of crime and vandalism have become part of everyday life in urban working class areas, and present methods of law enforcement are making little impact. In this situation The Workers' Party welcomes the initiative taken by The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors in their recently published discussion paper on Community Policing. The concept of Community policing provides good framework within which discussion can take place on the way any such scheme should be implemented, and The Workers' Party is currently involved in such a discussion.  Community involvement in local policing, if properly implemented, should prevent the escalation of crime rates by giving local people, community organisations and Associations a say in how their area is policed. One aspect of this should be to identify the conditions under which young people become involved in vandalism and drug-taking.  A proper system of Community Policing would also prevent the growth of private vigilante-type operations which represent a danger to the community by answering violence with violence, inevitably resulting in harm to innocent bystanders.  Community Policing must be seen in the context of our Antiquated legal and prison system and The Workers' Party supports reform in these areas.  In particular, The Workers' Party supports the establishment of a democratic independent Garda Authority.
AN GAELTACHT
Once again The Workers' Party commits itself to the establishment of a democratically elected authority for the Irish speaking districts.  Such an authority would require major financial and economic powers if the Gaeltachtai were to survive in any meaningful form.
Since the foundation of the State we have witnessed the progressive decline in the Irish speaking areas under all governments in spite of the lip service paid to the principle of securing "saol iomlan no fichiu aoise" for the residents.
The Workers' Party will fully support all positive measures that will enable Irish speakers within the Gaeltachtai to live their lives within those districts as full and equal citizens of the Republic.
WOMEN
The Workers' is committed unequivocally to safeguarding and promoting the rights of women in all spheres of life.
Our society places many burdens on women and creates numerous barriers to their full and equal participation.  Women have themselves made enormous strides in throwing off the old shackles and demanding the equal status that is theirs by right. The response to them by our legislators has been slow and very begrudging.
We recognise that in times of economic crisis such as we now face, the burdens on women weigh particularly heavily and the gains they have made are threatened. It is they who are expected to bear the brunt of savage cuts in health, education social welfare and other services which Fianna Fail and the Coalition put forward as 'solution' to the crisis. The Workers' Party  rejects this 'solution'. Our broad economic and social plan proposes a strategy which will make those who can afford to pay for the crisis do so.
- the speculators, the bankers, the get-rich-quick builders and the tax-dodgers.  The living standards of workers and their families must be protected and improved.
EMPLOYMENT:
The Workers' Party is pledged to work for the following measures:
- A programme to provide every woman will the opportunity and training necessary, to be in the labour force if she so wishes and to be at no disadvantage compared to any man in similar work.
- A  major training initiative to combat practices in industry which actively discriminate against women.
- Strengthen labour legislation to guarantee greater job security for part-time workers, who are mainly female, and to raise the very low income levels in those industries with an exclusively female workforce where comparibility with men's pay is impossible.
- expanded maternity and paternity leave and more flexible work arrangements for working parents.
- expansion of back-to-work courses which prepare women who have been out of the workforce for some time to re-enter employment.
EDUCATION:
A fundamental element of The Workers' programme for education is integrated schooling for all children regardless of sex or religion.
We will seek the elimination of sex role stereotyping by monitoring of textbooks and a programme of in-service training for teachers.  Career guidance should encourage both boys and girls to enter non-traditional fields of work.
We will press for the expansion of adult education facilities and in particular day-time classes with creches.
SOCIAL WELFARE
A very large proportion of social welfare claimants are women - widows, deserted wives, single mothers. The level and range of benefits are of particular concern, therefore, to women. In addition to raising benefits to a realistic level we are pledged to the elimination of
inequities in the social welfare code based on sex or marital status.
HOUSING, URBAN PLANNING AND TRANSPORT
The planning of housing and urban centres has shown an almost complete disregard for the needs of those who spend most time in them, i.e. women and young children. A condition of planning permission for new residential developments must be the provision of proper shopping facilities, playgrounds, washerterias, creche facilities and health centres.  Cheap and frequent transport services are essential and more attention must be paid to ease of
access and provision of  bus shelters.
Urban planners must be compelled to take account of the needs of parents with small children through the provision of wider footpaths, ramps and additional pedestrian crossings and more rest rooms in public buildings.
THE LAW
A whole range of legal changes as well as radical changes in social attitudes are necessary to improve the status of women and end exploitation.  The Workers' Party is already committed to the introduction of  comprehensive anti-discrimination which would make it illegal to engage in discriminatory practices against women in all areas of life. This law would supersede existing legislation where this conflicts with women's rights.
A permanent commission on women would be established to oversee the implementation of this law. The commission would have substantial powers of enforcement and its terms of reference would include the under-taking of an examination of the legal code to establish what further legislative change is in the interest of women.
The Workers' Party in Dail Eireann have already put down a bill to remove the constitutional prohibition on divorce. This bill will be re-activated in the new Dail.  We will be also seeking greater legal protection for women in marriage through the strengthening of the family Home Protection Act.  The law relating to domestic violence needs stronger enforcement and rape within marriage must be recognised as a crime.  Most urgently great changes are required in the attitudes of those who handle such cases, for example the gardai and police doctors as well as those of the general public.  The training programmes of such personnel must be modified to promote a greater awareness of the needs and special problems of women.
It is our conviction that the building of a more just and caring society in this country requires the full and active participation of women as equal partners.  The Workers' Party is pledged to ensuring that participation.  We all have a great deal to gain from it.
NORTHERN IRELAND
The Fianna Fail and the Fine Gael Parties use the problems of Northern Ireland to divert public attention from the very real problem of crisis proportions of the area for which they have direct responsibility.
Our Party is organised in Northern Ireland and is engaged in working for the unity of the working classes there - so that class politics rather than sectarian politics can begin to solve the very serious problems of Northern Ireland.
We stand for democracy in Northern Ireland.  We are opposed to coercion in all its forms.  We are opposed to attempts by bankrupt politicians in Fianna Fail and Fine Gael to coerce the population of Northern Ireland into all island unity. We say that their pretense to have a solution for the problems is untrue.
We in The Workers' Party are opposed to sectarian politics in Northern Ireland.  Our members are actively engaged in attempting to promote the unity of Catholics, Protestant and Dissenter through the political process for the common good of all. This can only be achieved on the basis of class rather than sectarian politics.
In an atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion this honest policy is not yet supported by all the working class in Northern Ireland - murder deepens the divisions between the communities.  In these difficult and deadly times we are much encouraged by the fact that our vote in Northern Ireland continues to grow.  We increased our vote very substantially.  A vote for The Workers' Party is, therefore, a vote for peace and understanding in Northern Ireland.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The danger of a nuclear armageddon is the greatest threat facing mankind today.  The Workers' Party maintains that the efforts of Ireland's foreign policy representative abroad must be energetically directed towards achieving complete nuclear disarmament.  As a first step towards this end we urge the implementation of the Helsinki Accord on strategic arms limitation.  Ireland must be firmly seen to be a nuclear free zone.
Consistent with this aim, a primary purpose of Ireland's foreign policy must be the international relaxation of tensions between all power blocs and between all nations.
We embrace the United Nations Charter as a basic element in our foreign policy.  Consistent with this aim, Ireland's neutrality must be strengthened and reinforced, and with this end in view, it is our aim that Ireland should ultimately join the non-aligned group of nations.
Consistent with our support of United Nations Charter as the proper foundation of international relations we maintain that disputes between nations must be resolved through negotiation rather than through force.
We assert also the right of nations to self-determination.  Thus we stand against all attempts by states to interfere either overtly or covertly with the sovereign rights of other states. We thus stand for the right of the Polish people to solve their deep problems without outside interference or pressures from the Soviet Union or any other state.  We support the right of the Palestinian people to a state of their own, and likewise, we defend the right of the Israelis to a state of their own.  This position we believe, can be the basis of a lasting peace in the Middle East.  We reject attempts by the United States to interfere covertly in the affairs of Central and South America, and of South Africa to interfere outside its borders.
As socialists and democrats we defend the democratic rights of the working class, and thus we reject the suspension of the free trade union Solidarity by the Polish Government, and we reject military rule as a "solution". We assert that Poland's problems can only be confronted through a deepening of socialism and democracy in that country.
