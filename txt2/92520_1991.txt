The election programme (draft)
The Election Committee of the Christian Democrats


With the help of their original, national programmes the Christian democrats worldwide brought about the well-being and prosperity of their countries, ensuring a harmonious development of all walks of public life and making the citizens fee a part of a community which safeguards their most vital interests.
Espousing spiritual and ethical values of Christianity, guided by the social teaching of the Catholic Church, the united Polish Christian Democrats wish to build a society of free individuals who take the responsibility for the fate of their families as well as national, local and the entire human community.
The Constitution of the Polish Republic must proceed from a clear-cut definition of human rights including the right of every human being to life since the moment of conception'
As we are for the unity of this country we oppose artificial regionalization. However, we intend to consolidate the existing economic and cultural links that exist between the present regions of Poland. 
Our economic programme relies on a verified social concept of market economy where human work is granted the rank it deserves. We postulate:
- to restitute the property rights of the society/and give priority to family entrepreneurship; 
-	to introduce sound currency and to lower interest rates; 
-	to introduce a stabile taxation system that will take into consideration the financial status of each family and to create new jobs;
- to ensure full employment by, among other things, initiating public works in the area of economic infrastructure and housing development; 
- to do away  with a bureaucratic management of the state administration and the national economy

- to revive the economy by launching a programme of housing development and municipal housing;
- to introduce a system of social benefits that will guarantee the social minimum and a decent level of old age and retirement pensions ; to  ensure a market for  agricultural produce which will guarantee profitability of that production, 
- to create conditions for efficient operation of genuine local government by lifting the existing tax burdens; 
- to introduce an independent anti-monopoly control agencies which will enjoy broad powers to combat unfair competition; 
- to counteract growing corruption, and particularly to adopt a law by which public officials will have to disclose the sources of their income; 
- to ensure an efficient operation of police force which will make citizens feel safer under the protection of law.
In foreign policy we opt for Poland's broad and equitable participation in the process of the European integration. We wish to foster friendly relations with all our neighbours and. particularly with Russia, and we oppose any form of Poland's dependence, be it political, military or economic/
While we favour the establishment of the all-European system of collective security we are of the opinion that the national defence system should be based on voluntary draft and well trained and equipped regular armed forces. 
We opt for Poland that is sovereign democratic morally sound, observing its laws found strong by the prosperity of its citizens!
