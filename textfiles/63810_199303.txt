WOMEN AND MEN 0F AUSTRALIA   CONCERNED CITIZENS ALL.
AUSTRALIA IS AT THE CROSSROADS.
NEVER IN THE FIELD 0F POLITICS HAS SO MUCH DAMAGE BEEN DONE TO SO MANY BY JUST ONE PERSON   PAUL KEATING.
TEN YEARS 0F LABOR HAS GIVEN "OUR GREAT COUNTRY CRIPPLING UNEMPLOYMENT   RECORD FOREIGN DEBT   RECORD BANKRUPTCIES AND RECORD FARM FAILURES   YOUNG AUSTRALIANS ARE DISILLUSIONED AND DISPIRITED AND THERE IS A SENSE 0F DESPAIR ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
ITS TIME THE CHIEF CULPRIT   KEATING   WAS THROWN OUT 0F OFFICE.
IT WAS PUT TO ME SIMPLY BY A YOUNG FAMILY MAN RECENTLY IN FRONT 0F THE BRISBANE GPO: "IF LABOR'S POLICIES ARE WORKING  THEN WHY AREN'T I?
WHY DONT I HAVE A JOB?"
DUES ANYONE SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT THE PARTY WHICH PUT THE NATION IN THIS DREADFUL SITUATION ...
DOES ANYONE BELIEVE THAT THE MAN MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR NATION'S CURRENT DILEMMA   CAN POSSIBLE PROVIDE ANY SOLUTIONS.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT LABOR LEADER KEATING IS A POLITICAL ANIMAL FIRST, AND,  SADLY, .
AN AUSTRALIAN CITIZEN SECOND.
HE HAS BEEN AT THE HELM 0F AUSTRALIA AS TREASURER OR PRIME MINISTER FOR OVER TEN YEARS   HE MUST BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE AUSTRALIA 0F 1993   THE UNEMPLOYMENT THE FOREIGN DEBT, THE BANKRUPTCIES, THE PERIOD WHERE INTEREST RATES WERE TOO HIGH FOR TOO LONG  KEATING SHOULD PAY THE PRICE!
1 MIGHT ADD THAT KEATING LOST ALL RIGHT TO USE THE GREAT AUSTRALIAN FLAG THE DAY HE ATTACKED THE FLAG ON FOREIGN SOIL    2 NAMELY IN JAKARTA, INDONESIA LAST YEAR.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I ASK YOU THESE TWO QUESTIONS:  HAVE Y OU HAD ENOUGH 0F TEN YEARS 0F HARD LABOR?
AND HAVE YOU HAD ENOUGH 0F KEATING AS PRIME MINISTER 0F THIS  COUNTRY?
WELL, I HAVE TOO, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS TIME TO CARE FOR YOUR COUNTRY; VOTE NATIONALS AND VOTE FOR JOBS.
JUST LOOK AT THE LABOR ADMINISTRATION IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AND UNTIL RECENTLY VICTORIA AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA, WHERE MILLIONS 0F TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS WERE LOST.
YOU JUST CANNOT TRUST LABOR, FEDERAL OR STATE, WITH TAXPAYERS' MONEY.
AT ONE END 0F THE SPECTRUM $161,000 FOR A BUREAUCRATS' BOUTIQUE BARBECUE, AND AT THE OTHER END THE BIG TICKET ITEM 0F $50 MILLION TO TRADE UNIONS DURING THE LIFE 0F THE LABOR GOVERNMENT.
AND SO, TODAY, I ADDRESS THIS SPEECH TO THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE 0F AUSTRALIA.
TEN YEARS 0F HARD LABOR HAS BEEN TEN YEARS 0F ECONOMIC VANDALISM, HUMAN MISERY ON A SCALE NOT KNOWN SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION   ALL AT THE BEHEST 0F A GOVERNMENT TOTALLY PREOCCUPIED WITH THE INTERESTS 0F BIG BUSINESS, BIG UNIONS AND BIG GOVERNMENTS, TO THE TOTAL EXCLUSION 0F;  THE QUIET ACHIEVERS  THE FARMERS AND FAMILIES  THE INDEPENDENT SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE  3 THOSE WHO ARE THE BACK50NE 0F OUR GREAT COUNTRY.
THEY HAVE BEEN IGNORED   THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY AN INCOMPETENT LABOR GOVERNMENT AND A PRIME MINISTER WHO NEITHER KNOWS NOR CARES ABOUT THEM.
AND SO I ADDRESS YOU IN THE SINCERE HOPE AND BELIEF THAT SWINGING VOTERS AROUND AUSTRALIA WILL SEE THROUGH THE LABOR LIES AND DECEIT AND RECOGNISE THAT OUR POLICIES ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THOSE IN THE COMMUN ITY WHO REALLY CAN PULL US OUT 0F THE RECESSION IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY.
WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS AND BETWEEN OBSCENE LANGUAGE SAYS "WHO CARES?", WELL I SAY I CARE AND THE NATIONAL PARTY CARES.
1 AM SICK AND TIRED 0F SEEING THE VALUES THAT MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT BEING LAUGHED AT AND IGNORED BY POWER BROKERS AND CYNICS.
I BELIEVE IN THE WORK ETHIC AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A JOB  1 BELIEVE IN COMMON SENSE  1 BELIEVE IN EQUALITY 0F OPPORTUNITY, NOT LABOR'S EOUALITY 0F OUTCOMES  1 BELIEVE IN FAMILY VALUES.,  AND I BELIEVE IN A FAIR GO AND THAT IS WHAT I BRING TO YOU AS LEADER 0F THE NATIONAL PARTY.
1 BRING TO YOU A DETERMINATION TO BRING COMMON SENSE, DECENCY AND THE VALUES 0F THE COUNTRY TO THE GOVERNANCE 0F THIS COUNTRY.
IT MAY BE A LONG WAY FROM BOREE CREEK TO CANBERRA, BUT THE THINGS THAÏ ARE RIGHT AND TRUE IN BOREE CREEK ARE RIGHT AND TRUE IN CANBERRA.
TIM FISCHER WILL NEVER LOSE TOUCH AND WILL CONTINUE TO STAND IN FRONT 0F POST OFFICES   IN GOVERNMENT   AND BE AVAILABLE ACROSS THE ELECTORATE 0F FARRER AND ACROSS AUSTRALIA.
BUT, 0F COURSE, THERE MUST BE MORE THAN JUST THIS.
THERE MUST BE STABLE GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMIC POLICIES WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE RIGHT FRAMEWORK FOR CONFIDENCE, EXPANDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES, GROWTH/ AND THE ABILITY TO REPAIR THE LEGACY 0F LABOR.
WHAT WE NEED IS CONFIDENCE AND GROWTH   AND I CALL ON ALL AUSTRALIANS, WHETHER ENVIRONMENTALIST OR 0F ABORIGINAL HERITAGE OR ANY OTHER GROUPING, TO ACCEPT THAT, GROWTH IN OUR NATION IS THE ONLY ECONOMIC SAVIOUR.
IT IS ONLY THROUGH GROWTH THAT WE CAN AFFORD PENSIONS, DOLE PAYMENTS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT BENEFITS.
IT IS ONLY THROUGH GROWTH THAT IMPROVING LIVING STANDARDS CAN BE ACHIEVED AND JOBS CREATED RIGHT ACROSS AUSTRALIA.
THE NATIONAL PARTY UNDERSTANDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH   OUR MEMBERSHIP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MADE UP 0F THOSE WHO WORKED HARD TO DELIVER PROPER BALANCED DEVELOPMENT, AND NOT JUST TALKED ABOUT IT.
1 AM PROUD 0F THE COALITION POLICIES WHICH WE ARE PRESENTING TO THE AUSTRALIAN ELECTORATE, AND PROUD 0F THE NATIONAL PARTY'S CONTRIBUTION TO THESE POLICIES.
OUR POLICIES TRULY ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS FACING OUR NATION.
THEY MASSIVELY REDUCE BUSINESS    COSTS, INCLUDING THE COSTS 0F EMPLOYING PEUPLE, THEY MASSIVELY REDUCE THE COSTS 0F EXPORTS, THEY MASSIVELY REDUCE THE COST 0F TRANSPORT.
IN REGARD TO OUR POLICIES SPECIFICALLY, I SAY TO YOU AS LEADER 0F THE NATIONAL PARTY, I GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE N0 GST BEFORE PETROL FUEL EXCISE, DIESEL FUEL EXCISE AND AVGAS FUEL EXCISE IS ENTIRELY ABOLISHED.
FOR MOTORISTS, AN AVERAGE 0F $11.40 SAVING PER TANKFUL.
AND HERE IS THE LEGISLATION THAT ABOLISHES ALL PETROL AND DIESEL FUEL EXCISE TAX AND AVGAS FUEL EXCISE TAX, N0 IFS, N0 BUTS.
IN TERMS 0F THIS NATIONAL PARTY CAHPAIGN LAUNCH TODAY, I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE OR AFFIRM THE FOLLOWING:  IN ADDITION TO THE ABOLITION 0F PETROL, DIESEL AND AVGAS FUEL EXCISE, WE WILL ALSO ABOLISH ALL EXCISE ON FUEL OÏL, HEATING OÏL AND KEROSENE;  SECOND, MANY RURAL INDUSTRIES FACE DESPERATE TIMES.
ALL WILL BE HELPED BY FIGHTBACK, BUT I PARTICULARLY REFER TO THE PLIGHT 0F THE WOOL INDUSTRY.
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED STABILITY FOR THE INDUSTRY, THE COALITION WILL COMMIT AN ADDITIONAL $20 MILLION IN 1994/95 FOR WOOL PROMOTION FUNDING, TO MAKE A TOTAL 0F $40 MILLION IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS 0F A COALITION GOVERNMENT.
FURTHER, WE RECOGNISE THAT PROMOTION ALONE WILL NOT SAVE THOUSANDS 0F WOOL GROWERS WHO ARE OPERATING AT LESS THAN    THE COST 0F PRODUCTION.
THE DEPUTY NATIONAL PARTY LEADER AND SHADOW MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY, BRUCE LLOYD, WILL ANNOUNCE FURTHER PROPOSALS ON THE WOOL INDUSTRY IN THE PRIMARY INDUSTRY POLICY LAUNCH TOMORROW.
I CAN, HOWEVER, SAY THAT UNDER A COALITION GOVERNMENT THERE WILL BE AN URGENT REVIEW 0F THE WOOL INDUSTRY SITUATION AND THE POSSIBLE NEED FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN THE OPERATION 0F THE AUSTRALIAN WOOL REALISATION COMMISSION.
WE WILL LEGISLATE FOR THE PROTECTION 0F OUR NATIONAL FLAG.
PROTECTION BOTH FROM DAMAGE AND ALSO FROM CHANGE, UNLESS THERE HAS BEEN A VOTE 0F THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE.
WE WILL NEGOTIATE WITH ALL THOSE AFFECTED BY THE MABO HIGH COURT DECISION, HOWEVER I WANT TO MAKE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT A COALITION GOVERNMENT WILL LEGISLATE IF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL   TO PROVIDE FOR THE REQUIRED CERTAINTY AND SECURITY 0F LAND TITLE, IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARISING FROM THE MABO HIGH COURT DECISION.
WE WILL LEGISLATE TO ENSURE RESOURCE SECURITY ON A SUSTAINABLE BASIS AND CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT 0F SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TO ENSURE THAT ALL FACTORS ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, NOT JUST POLITICAL ONES, REGARDING DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.
WE WILL EXAMINE THE NSW COALITION GOVERNMENT'S MODEL LEGISLATION TO CREATE AND EFFECTIVE NATIONAL CO OPERATIVE NETWORK.
WE WILL ENCOURAGE A NATION WIDE FRAMEWORK FOR COOPERATIVES TO GIVE GREATER SUBSTANCE TO THE VALUE ADDING  DEBATE.
WE WILL AMEND STANDING ORDERS TO REFORM THE PROCEEDINGS 0F QUESTION TIME IN THE HOUSE 0F REPRESENTATIVES/ TO PROVIDE AN INSTITUTION 0F WHICH YOU, THE PEOPLE, CAN BE PROUD.
UNDER US, ABUSE IS OUT   SUBSTANCE IS IN!
WE WILL REVIEW THE 1992 BUDGET LEGISLATION WHICH IMPACTS ON PENSIONERS HOLDING SHARES/ EVEN THOUGH THESE SHARES ARE NOT NECESSARILY TRADED, AND WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE IS A CAPITAL GAINS TAX EXEMPTION FOR CAPITAL GAINS 0F LESS THAN $3000.
THIS WILL FURTHER HELP PENSIONERS AND ALSO RETIREES WHOSE THRESHOLD LEVEL WILL BE BOOSTED TO OVER $10 000.
WE WILL AMEND THE ASSETS TEST SO THAT IT DOES NOT APPLY TO RETIREES & PENSIONERS LIVING ON THE FAMILY FARM OR FOR ISOLATED CHILDREN/ OR FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEEMED TO BE IN ECONOMIC HARDSHIP, AS PART 0F THE RURAL ADJUSTMENT SCHEME.
WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL DOMESTIC FLIGHT SECTORS FOR INTERNATIONAL TOURISTS WHICH ARE BOOKED OVERSEAS ARE ENTIRELY FREE 0F GST.
THIS WILL TAKE EFFECT FROM I OCTOBER 1994 AND WILL PROVIDE A BIG BOOST TO DECENTRALISED TOURISM   IF YOU LIKE, IT IS THE 'MT ISA, MACKAY, MUDGEE, MILDURA CLAUSE'.
WE WILL ENSURE THAT FEDERAL CABINET MEETINGS ARE HELD PERIODICALLY BEYOND CANBERRA AND BEYOND THE MAJOR CAPITALS.
JOHN HEWSON AND I ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING A COALITION GOVERNMENT WHICH IS NOT COCOONED IN CANBERRA.
MIGHT I ALSO SAY THAT JOHN HEWSON WILL MAKE A GREAT PRIME MINISTER 0F AUSTRALIA.
HE WILL NOT BUCKLE, HE WILL GET THE JOB DONE.
WE WILL REIMSTATE ON A FULLTIME BASIS THE TWO REGULAR INFANTRY (BRISBANE) BATTALIONS ABOLISHED BY LABOR AND EXPAND THE NUMBER 0F CHINOOK HELICOPTERS FROM FOUR TO EIGHT; ESSENTIAL NOT ONLY FOR DEFENCE BUT ALSO VITAL IN TIMES 0F MASSIVE FLOODING.
WE WILL ENSURE A PAIR GO FOR RAIL IN AUSTRALIA   AND, AS A STARTING POINT, THE FIGHTBACK PACKAGE WILL DELIVER A $258 MILLION ANNUAL OPERATIONAL BOOST TO RAIL ACROSS AUSTRALIA.
RAIL WILL ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR 'REBUILD AUSTRALIA FUND ' ASSISTANCE.
WITH THE CO OPERATION 0F STATE GOVERNMENTS, WE WILL ENSURE THAT THERE IS A FOUR LANE HIGHWAY (2X2 LANES) WHICH STRETCHES FROM NAMBOUR AND BRISBANE, THROUGH SYDNEY TO MELBOURNE.
WE WILL EXPAND MEDICARE ACCESS TO PROVIDE THAT EVERY RURAL TOWN WITH A CHEMIST  HAS ACCESS TO ITS OWN MEDICARE AGENCY SO THAT THERE IS BETTER ACCESS FOR THOSE IN RURAL AND REGIONAL AUSTRALIA   PARTICULARLY THE ELDERLY.
WE WILL ENSURE THAT WITHIN ONE HUNDRED DAYS, LABOR'S HYPOCRITICAL AND ILLOGICAL 'THREE MINES' URANIUM POLICY IS COMPLETELY ABOLISHED, RESULTING IN MORE JOBS WITH THE MINING INDUSTRY.
WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE UNDEMOCRATIC PRACTICE 0F COMPULSORY UNIONISM IS ENTIRELY ABOLISHED THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA.
IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL BREACH 0F HUMAN RIGHTS AND IT WILL END UNDER A COALITION GOVERNMENT.
EVERY AUSTRALIAN WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO BELONG OR THE RIGHT NOT TO BELONG TO A UNION.
WE WILL SPECIFICALLY TARGET RURAL EDUCATION.
THE OLD COUNTRY PARTY WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE ESTABLISHMENT 0F THE FIRST RURAL UNIVERSITY IN NSW   THE UNIVERSITY 0F NEW ENGLAND AT ARMIDALE.
THERE ARE NOW TOO MANY RESTRICTIONS AND A RIDICULOUS RATIONING SYSTEM IMPOSED BY LABOR, BOTH FOR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STUDIES.
WE WILL FREE UP THIS SYSTEM SO THAT THERE IS EXPANDED ACCESS FOR EXTERNAL STUDENTS SO THAT YOUTH IN RURAL AND REGIONAL AUSTRALIA HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION WITH A SIX PERCENT INCREASE IN AUSTUDY PAYMENTS AND AN OPEN LEARNING SYSTEM THAT WORKS.
WE WILL GIVE AUSTRALIA A FAIR DINKUM, PAIR TRADE STRATEGY, WHICH WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE PLAIN FACT THAT THERE IS N0 SUCH THING AS THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.
WE HAVE DEVELOPED A STRATEGY ~ THE FISHER/FORREST/FISCHER STRATEGY (IN RECOGNITION 0F THE INPUT 0F MY COLLEAGUE PETER FISHER, AND MY SOON TO BE COLLEAGUE, JOHN FORREST   THE FORMER AND FUTURE MEMBERS FOR MALLEE), WHICH WILL WORK.
THERE WILL BE AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE ABSOLUTELY ADEQUATE ANTIDUMPING LAWS.
WE WON'T ALLOW DUMPING 0F SUBSTANDARD IMPORTED PRODUCE/ BECAUSE, FOR EXAMPLE, I DONT WANT TO SEE SNOW PEA PRODUCERS IN BUNDABERG HAVING THEIR LIVING STANDARDS RUINED    BY SUBSTANDARD AND DUMPED ZIMBABWE SNOW PEAS.
AND TKAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS UNDER LABOR.
WE WILL HAVE STRICT LABELLING REQUIREMENTS SO THAT ONLY AUSTRALIAN PRODUCE CAN BE LABELLED AS PRODUCT 0F AUSTRALIA.
BECAUSE, UNDER LABOR, THE CONSUMER IS CONSTANTLY HOODWINKED INTO BELIEVING THAT WHAT THEY ARE BUYING IS AUSTRALIAN, WHEN OFTEN IT ISN'T.
WE WILL COMPLETE THE REVAMPING 0F BOTH THE AUSTRALIAN QUARANTINE INSPECTION SERVICE AND THE NATIONAL FOOD AUTHORITY.
FINALLY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I REAFFIRM MY ABSOLUTE COMMITMENT TO THE FUNDAMENTAL DYNAMIC 0F FIGHTBACK.
THE ABOLITION 0F PAYROLL TAX, SALES TAX, FUEL EXCISE TAX   IN FACT GOODBYE SEVEN TAXES   THE TOTAL GUILLOTINING 0F SEVEN TAXES, ALONG WITH A HUGE REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX, A BIG BOOST IN FAMILY ALLOWANCE   AND IT IS ALL FULLY FUNDED, UNLIKE LABOR'S PROMISES.
THIS FUNDING EQUATION FLOWS FROM THE PROCEEDS 0F A FAIR GOODS AND SERVICES TAX, ALONG WITH CUTBACKS IN CERTAIN AREAS 0F GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE.
FOR EXAMPLE, WE WILL CUT $200 MILLION FROM FOREIGN AID TO COUNTRIES BEYOND OUR REGION.
1 WOULD ALSO HIGHLIGHT TO YOU OUR COMMITMENT TO AN ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION SCHEDULE.
THIS GIVES REAL INCENTIVE FOR FARMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OPERATORS TO GO OUT AND 'BREAK THE BACK' 0F THIS RECESSION AND UPGRADE THEIR EQUIPMENT   IT ALSO APPLIES TO EXISTING EQUIPMENT.
I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WE CHANNEL THE ENERGIES 0F AUSTRALIANS IN TINY RURAL HAMLETS AND LARGE REGIONAL CENTRES TO GET RID 0F LABOR, TO GIVE BACK TO AUSTRALIA A STRONG, WILLING NATIONAL PARTY PRESENCE IN GOVERNMENT.
THE NATIONAL PARTY IS NEEDED  MORE THAN EVER BEFORE IN THESE TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES   PERHAPS EVEN MORE SO IN THESE TIMES 0F CENTRALISED MEDIA.
A GREAT DEAL 0F THE DIFFICULTY ENCOUNTERED BY SO MANY SMALL EXPORT INDUSTRIES, RURAL INDUSTRIES AND SMALL BUSINESS GENERALLY IS SIMPLY IN GETTING THE MESSAGE ACROSS AND GETTING A RESPONSE FROM THE GOVERNMENTS   STATE AND FEDERAL DRIVEN BY THE BUREAUCRATS MORE AND MORE ISOLATED FROM THE MAIN STREAM.
FRANKLY, THE ADVENT 0F TV AGGREGATION HAS ADDED TO THIS BURDEN WITH CAPITAL CITY PRIORITIES DOMINATING MEDIA PRIORITIES WHICH IN TURN OFTEN DOMINATES GOVERNMENT DEC I SI ON MAKING IN PRIORITIES AND POLICIES.
THE NATIONAL PARTY UNASHAMEDLY IS ALL ABOUT GIVING VOICE TO BOTH AUSTRALIA'S LEGITIMATE NATIONAL INTEREST ON ISSUES SUCH AS ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS AND IMMIGRATION, AND ALSO A STRONG VOICE FOR THAT AREA 0F AUSTRALIA BEYOND SYDNEY, CANBERRA AND MELBOURNE WHICH CONTRIBUTES SO MUCH TO THE STANDARD 0F LIVING 0F ALL AUSTRALIANS.
WE WANT TO BUILD ON THAT RECORD CREATED IN GOVERNMENT BY PEOPLE SUCH AS DOUG ANTHONY.
I ACKNOWLEDGE DOUG'S PRESENCE HERE TODAY AND HE DESERVES A ROUND 0F APPLAUSE FOR HIS GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO AUSTRALIA.
I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE ROB BORBIDGE'S PRESENCE ALONG WITH THE DEPUTY PREMIER 0F NEW SOUTH WALES, WAL MURRAY, AND MANY OTHER NATIONAL PARTY MEMBERS AND SENATORS AND IN PARTICULAR, LARRY ANTHONY AND MIKE EMERSON.
1 THANK THEM FOR THEIR WELCOME AND  INTRODUCTION AND SAY CATEGORICALLY THAT LARRY ANTHONY AND MIKE EMERSON HAVE BEEN A INSPIRATION TO THE OVERALL CAMPAIGN AND STAND READY TO WIN THE SEATS 0F RICHMOND AND PAGE.
VICTORY IN THOSE SEATS WILL ENSURE THAT KEATING AND LABOR ARE DRIVEN OUT 0F OFFICE.
COULD I PARTICULARLY HIGHLIGHT OUR CANDIDATE FOR CAPRICORNIA IN QUEENSLAND.
MARGARET GOODY HAS DEMONSTRATED AN ENORMOUS CAPACITY FOR HARD WORK AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WELCOMING HER AS THE MEMBER FOR CAPRICORNIA BECAUSE MARGARET IS GOING TO BANISH LABOR FROM CAPRICORNIA AND THAT WILL BE A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT.
WE ARE ON THE VERGE 0F A NEW AND EXCITING ERA.
IN MY HEART, I AM FULL 0F HOPE FOR THE FUTURE 0F OUR GREAT COUNTRY.
WE HAVE EARNED THE RIGHT TO TAKE OVER THE MANTLE 0F GOVERNMENT   WE HAVE THE RIGHT POLICIES, WE HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE, WE HAVE THE ENERGY, ABILITIES AND COMMONSENSE TO TURN THIS COUNTRY AROUND.
NEVER HAS THE COUNTRY BEEN IN.GREATER NEED.
IN MY CLOSING WORDS TO YOU, I CANNOT PUT IT BETTER THAN THE WORDS 0F OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM:  "WITH COURAGE LET US ALL COMBINE TO ADVANCE AUSTRALIA FAIR.
"
