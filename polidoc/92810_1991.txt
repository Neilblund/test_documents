13 MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES BEFORE POLAND
- THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM IS INALIENABLE 
Man is entitled to such inalienable rights as: the right to individual freedom, freedom of conscience, speech, association and economic activity /hose rights are deeply rooted in Christian values and the teachings of the Church./
- PARLIAMENT LEGISLATES, GOVERNMENT EXECUTES AND PRESIDENT TAKES CARE OF THE STATE 
Parliament is responsible for the adoption of laws. It appoints a strong executive authority - the government. The president should ensure an efficient cooperation between the legislative and the executive; safeguard the fundamental interests of the state and to represent Poland in its foreign relations. Independent and objective courts safeguard the observance of the law.
- A MODERN STATE SHOULD POSSESS A MODERN ARMY AND AN EFFICIENT POLICE FORCE.
State security should be ensured by a regular army. The  duty of state protection should be discharchged by well trained draftees. State police should take care of internal safety, while local police should enforce law and order. 7
- POLAND MUST HAVE ITS DUE PLACE IN EUROPE AND WORLDWIDE Poland is ready to take part in the shaping of Europe and to manifest its presence in the world in which each people and state has the right to an independent existence. The principles underlying exchanges in all the spheres should be equitable and guarantee security each individual and all men together.
- THE ECONOMY UST BE WISELY TRANSFORMED 
The government is responsible for the changes that take place in the economy. They are to benefit the people. The changes must be gradual and well prepared, particularly in those sectors which employ the major part f the population and where the transformations are most difficult.
- THE S ATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ECONOMIC STRATEGY
If we want our reforms to succeed and to see POLAND'S resurrection we need more animated reforms is necessary to partially cancel some of the debts, to facilitate access to credits and thus to adjust financial liabilities that they no longer thwart production. It is necessary to identify those areas economically and socially which are viable, particularly agriculture and housing construction.
- POLAND'S ECONOMY IS TO REMAIN IN POLISH HANDS 
Privatisation should offer preferences for domestic capital via lease of enterprises, prolonged payment of loans and introduction of mortgage credits.
- RESTITUTION OF PROPERTY SHOULD NOT HARM ANYONE
-Property restitution - or reprivatisation - should take the form of capital vouchers and in some well justified cases - it should be in kind. It cannot violate any existing property titles/The and distributed as a result of nationalisation belongs to the farmers./
- MODERN ECONOMY STANDS FOR PRIVATE OWNERSHIP, STABLE AND STRONG CURRENCY 
In future Poland's economy should rest on private property/stable and convertible currency/and broad economic cooperation with other countries.
- BULLS' EYE - WHEN ONE STAKES ON AGRICULTURE.

GOVERNMENT POLICY MUST DEFEND POLISH AGRICULTURE AND GIVE IT A CHANCE
The government agricultural policy must create conditions for the development of modern and profitable agriculture. It is necessary to organize the agricultural market so that it will guarantee the sales of staple produce at minimum negotiable prices. This will facilitate investment and modernization, particularly in food processing. It is necessary to open access to cheap credits on favourable terms and to offer tax exemptions/Exports of produce may help Poland regain its international economic standing. We can have adequate, healthy and cheap food and feed our neighbours, too. 
- EDUCATION AND CULTURE PROTECT OUR IDENTITY AND DIGNITY  
To ensure an equitable access to schools we must change the educational system. The state should equitably finance education in various schools, chosen by pupils themselves and run by teachers, parents and students' self-government Culture should be subsidized by the state. 
- NO ECONOMIZING ON PUBLIC HEALTH - NO SPONGING ON THE SOCIETY/ Health care and social welfare (allowances, old age and disability
-pensions) should be financed by insurance systems and should also offer additional non-gratuitous services. The right to an unemployment benefit cannot be abused by those why do not want to take up work and participate in public works.
- WHILE TAKING CARE OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT WE PROTECT OUR FUTURE
Environmental protection should become a focus of special attention of the state. The observance of ecological laws, promotion of "clean" investment projects, which can be done with foreign assistance and the production of healthy food, will testify that we are concerned about future generations.
