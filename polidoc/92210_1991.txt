THE ELECTION PLATFORM OF THE ALLIANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEFT
WE CANNOT GO ON LIKE THAT ANY LONGER!
Two years have passed since the political forces stemming from
''Solidarity” trade unions took the responsibility for the future of Poland. Under their rule the industrial output dropped by over 40 per cent, the real wages decreased by one third, nearly 2 million people have no jobs, state enterprises are on the verge of (default due to high taxation, farmers find it difficult to sell their produce, no progress has
been made in the restructuring of the economy, the number of apartments dropped to the level from the fifties, the educational system and health care are in decline and large groups of society live below the poverty line. Almost parallel we hear about various swindles and acts of larceny of the national property/
An enormous capital of confidence and public patience has been wasted. Not even a single major public problem has been solved/On the contrary - new problems have emerged and the current crisis has deepened.
It is paradoxical that political parties which are responsible for the failures of the two former cabinets shun that responsibility and have assumed a position of an opposition.
Unprecedented in today's Europe, Poland's economic decline in the past two years is the result of:
- the wrong economic policy underlined by the liberal doctrine Poland pays an enormous price for illusions of the ruling elite who
assumed that the "invisible hand of the free market" and a monetary policy will ensure economic stability and development. Now we suffer the consequences of the fact that two subsequent governments, both
from the solidarity camp, have succumbed to the terms dictated by the International Monetary Fund
political bickering and incompetence of a major part of the ruling elite who act on the premise that •the Third Polish Republic can be raised only on the rubble of the Polish People's Republic, and accordingly they also destroy the positive legacy of the former system, which could have been improved.
As a result of that policy we see a growing disintegration of the society, the collapse of all authorities, loss of public confidence and further decline of Poland's prestige at the international arena.


WE CANNOT GO ON LIKE THAT ANY LONGER. It is necessary to check Poland's further degradation and stop the policies t1jat have nothing in common with the well-being of the working people.
In order to bring about a major breakthrough we need a strong parliamentary representation of the left that will enjoy public support. We need the presence of such political forces which will aim at reconciling economic needs with social needs within the framework of
the market economy. The left which will correct social imperfections of the market economy and like western social-democrats will co-author such socio-economic systems which brought economic prosperity to the countries of Western Europe.
In this election we stand together as the Alliance of the Democratic Left. This alliance has been formed by social-democrats, socialists, trade unionists, co-operative activists, representatives of youth and women organizations, as well as various associations which struggle for a better life for the homeless and unemployed.
We propose a socio-economic and socio-political programme which is an alternative to the one that is currently carried out.
seats in Poland and to prevent in order to check Poland's economy, to identify clear goals of strategic development that will enable Poland to attain the level of the developed countries; 
- to work out such a social policy which will be based on the principle of justice, but which will not offer alms; 
- to consolidate Poland's security and sovereignty)
- DEMOCRACY
Democracy is such a system of values underlying the life of the state and society that we espouse and want to apply Poland's problems can be resolved only in a democratic system)
We think that in order to overcome the economic crisis and to carry the reforms Poland does not need a “strongman”.
We perceive the economic and social safety of citizens as a major premise of the democratic order which ensures its stability)

We opt for the system of parliamentary democracy;
Our parliamentary representatives will endorse a Constitution which will:
- clearly and unequivocally ensure the parliament's supreme function in the political system,;
- create a legal framework to ensure a strong position for the president who will safeguard the Constitution and the laws and will act as an arbiter - and not a party - in any disputes that might arise between political parties, and who will see to it that the authorities stay in touch with the nation;
- ensure adequate conditions for the functioning of the stable executive, an efficient government which will be subordinated to executive, parliament. Government stability should rest on the principle that a cabinet may be dismissed on condition a clear parliamentary majority exists which can form a new cabinet;
- create unrestricted prospects for the development and operation to political parties and social organizations that represent interests, aspirations and views of various public groups of society
- ensure freedom of association for trade unions and other employee organizations and their equality in the negotiations with employers; trade unions must have a possibility to influence state decisions which concern working and living conditions of citizens;/
- define stable principles of the election law so that they cannot be amended depending on the political situation.;
Self-governed civic society
We think that the state should not assume those functions which can be better discharged by local communities, economic entities or individuals Our parliamentary representatives will take steps to:
- promote local self-government. It is necessary to remove any obstacles before self-government by creating real legal conditions for their independent operation. It is necessary to amend those laws which regulate their revenues and the scope of competence, We opt for the establishment of self-governing bodies also at the provincial level prevent any attempts at abolishing tenant self-government This kind of self-government should have legislative guarantees of its functioning and the broadest possible support of local councils
- foster employee and professional self-government in a way which will be adequate to new circumstances; employees should be granted the right of equal participation in the transformations and the operation of their companies;
- ensure broader representation of citizens and local communities whenever decisions of major importance to the public are made. We favour the establishment of public institutions which will advance legislative initiatives and we opt for referenda the results of which will be binding for the authorities
We support he development of local government/and oppose the concepts which have recently been propounded of dividing Poland into autonomous lands, because we see this as a thereat to Poland's raison d'etre.
The state of the law which protects the security of its citizens.
In our view an underlying principle in the state of the law is the respect for the Constitution as strict observance of the law by all

state agencies and public institutions. Relations between the state and its citizens or their representations should be based solely an exclusively on the laws or regulations ranking as parliamentary acts.
Our deputies will ensure that citizens can lodge complaints with
and will opt for a strong position of the independent ombudsman) They parliament; that administrative decisions are controlled by the courts 
will oppose any attempts by particular political parties at controlling

courts and prosecutors' offices. They will ensure the observance of a principle that the concern for the safety of citizens is one of the state's priorities. ..
Of great significance is the establishment of institutional (legal, organizational and individual) safeguards which will protect the society against growing bribery and corruption. This is particularly important now that large scale ownership transformations have been launched, and particularly when public property is privatized.
Our parliamentarians will oppose the emergence of any illegal and unconstitutional institutions or groups whose indention is combat corruption because they will perceive this as a come-back to the former, discredited practices.
Religious neutrality of the democratic state/
We opt for a clearly secular state, the separation of the Roman-Catholic Church and other denominations from the state and the state's neutral attitude towards its citizens' religious beliefs. The church and other religious organizations should be guaranteed equal rights and freedom of religious, practice.
We are concerned by attempts to violate those principles which are accepted as standard in the democratic Europe and countries of the world.
our representatives will firmly oppose any acts violating freedom of conscience and religion in education and elsewhere, and the use of the Church to serve particular political needs of various parties and groups. 
We welcome the cooperation between the state and the Church, as well as other religions, in improving the morals the nation, consolidating family life, and assisting those who live in poverty.
The democratic informational order
We are of the opinion that mass media should serve as a means of public control over the functioning of the state, reflect public opinions, views and postulates on the functioning of parliament, government and
the state administration. They should offer a variety of communities and groups an opportunity to express their opinions
Our parliamentary representatives will opt for such a role of mass media which is adequate to modern democracies, we oppose:
- Any steps at subordinating the information policy to the ruling parties, which was the practice of the past;
- Such a commercialization of mass media which will put them in the hands of those who have sufficient financial resources.
It is of utmost importance to us that the state radio and television serve the entire, society and are under its constant control.
- THE PRESENT CRISIS OF THE POLISH ECONOMY CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE AND RADICAL CHANGES
In the first place it is necessary to reject the wrong economic doctrine of this government that inflation can be combated by imposing
rigorous restrictions on consumption. The inflation in Poland is not an            effect of a high consumption but results from high costs of goods.
That is why it cannot be combated by simply maintaining extremely low living standards of the working people.
Our deputies will propose a programme of immediate and radical changes which will, among others, embrace the following measures:
- One, to abolish the excess wage tax which discriminates state enterprises.


It should be abolished in those branches of industry where „sufficient competition exists either on the domestic or foreign markets or in those areas of economy where the state enterprises are in minority (e.g., state farms).
Those enterprises which have a monopolistic position and could take advantage of the tax abolition and rapidly increase wages, financed by price hikes of their products, it is necessary to control their price policy until they become demonopolized.
- Two, to abolish the capital tax, or the so called mandatory "dividend" which is levied on state enterprises and to replace it by a uniform corporate income tax.
- Three, to give up a fixed rate of exchange and to replace it by a floating rate.
The fixed rate of exchange of zloty has become a major export barrier. It favours imports to the detriment of domestic production floating rate of exchange should do away with this negative
- Phenomenon and ensure trade balance
- Four, to expand credits with preferential interest rates for investment projects scheduled in some selected sectors of economy.) The same goal may be attained by giving up the policy of positive interest on credits and term deposits because it is this interest rate that accounts for higher production costs of state enterprises and contributes to higher inflation.
- Five, to change the taxation system by increasing the turnover tax on luxurious consumer goods so that the taxation burden is put on people with higher incomes and by simplifying the taxation system for small business and services.
- Six, to balance the state budget by cutting spending, curbing the expansion'' of the administration, the chancellery as well as other offices of Parliament and the Senate, and by foregoing their luxurious furnishing and interior decoration, by stopping lavishness of the privatisation process, and by cutting generous remunerations for the services rendered by western advisers and consulting companies.
- Seven, to change immediately the restructuring of the state industry currently under way to the effect that:
- the Agency for Industrial Restructuring focuses on supporting the restructuring and modernization instead of profitably investing the resources at their disposal;


- Advantageous credits which Poland has been offered by the World Bank are efficiently used for restructuring, because to date their utilization has been extremely ineffective.
- Eight, to change immediately the state unemployment, policy should focus on steps fostering consumption and development is also necessary to launch investment projects on the area of infrastructure that will be financed by the state budget.
- Nine, to introduce price control staple consumer goods and services for the benefit of the poorest.
- Ten, to change the tariff policy in order to efficiently monitor an uncontrolled outflow of foreign currency from Poland.
By implementing this crisis programme we will be able to stop the economic decline in a matter of months.
-  TOWARDS A SOCIAL MARKET DEMO RACY
We favour the social market economy which is an economy that combines competition with an active role of the state in creating proper conditions of development for its citizens and offering social security programmes.
Active role of the state
The state should support the market by creating legal safeguards against monopolies and the abuse of economic freedoms.
By determining the interest rate of credits, the taxation and exchange rate and by its tariffs policy the state should support the development of those branches of industry which are innovative, promote technological progress and curb unemployment, and which contribute to the safe existence of the society.
The state should offer its support when it comes to:
- introduction of energy-saving technologies; /
- exports and economic animation of the regions affected by unemployment; 
- housing development
- economic security of the state (production and extraction of fuels, power generation and defence industry).
Equality of all forms of ownership
The state policy should not give priority to or discriminate any
- agriculture, food processing and storage of produce
- establishment of infrastructure (telecommunications, airports, roads and border check-points form of ownership. Our parliamentary representatives will opt for the equitable treatment of private, state, co-operative, municipal and mixed property/There are no grounds to maintain that complete privatisation of our economy is the best possible solution. 
Our deputies will support the following paths of ownership transformations:
- ESOP, i.e., transformation of an enterprise into a joint-stock company whose shares are in the hands of its employees;
- Buy-out or lease of the company's assets by employee self-government;
- when employees themselves take the risk of running their own company (as it happens in a co-operative);
- commercialization of an enterprise, which means that it is transformed into a one-man company;
- transformation of an enterprise into a joint-stock company by 
floatation of shares to all who are interested, including foreign capital. 
When a form of ownership transformation is chosen, it is
imperative to consider the opinion of employees.
We oppose a bureaucratic privatization
Our deputies will:
support the privatization of small and medium size state
enterprises with a considerable employee participation. Those enterprises should be privatized in the first place in which the administrative costs are too high and account for their unprofitability
- firmly oppose the privatization of the best and most efficient state enterprises, the valuation of the, state assets by western experts without any parliamentary control. They will oppose the "liquidation" procedures which result in bureaucratic distortions of the economic process and in the take-over of the state property at reduced prices by a few "insiders";
- oppose free distribution of shares of state enterprises because it is an attempt on the part of the current political elite to take advantage of the situation, and it might result in a delayed economic catastrophe at the time the shares are sold out;
- firmly demand that the funds raised out of privatization of state enterprises are earmarked for fostering economic growth,, and particularly for the acceleration of structural transformations.
We opt for the development of co-operative and municipal property.

It is necessary to support restructured and economically efficient co-operatives which are capable of competing on the market with private and state companies is also indispensable to develop communal property, but first of all to combat unemployment, to protect the environment and to develop the infrastructure for municipal housing and apartments built by enterprises, to develop local transportation, to animate culture and recreation
Inviolable are the decisions of the agrarian reform and the nationalization act.

Our deputies will firmly endorse the inviolability of the decisions of the agrarian reform and the nationalization act as well as other legislation which was adopted to compensate the society for the losses this country suffered during the Second World War.
We do not recognize the claims of former proprietors who demand the restitution of their property. However, it is necessary to make up for the acts of wrongdoing whenever the law was violated By way of compensation capital coupons should be offered with which the shares of the privatized companies could be purchased
It is necessary to stop a destruction of

Polish agriculture
As a result of a deep recession of Poland's economy which began in 1990 and a drastic drop in the consumption of agricultural produce, Polish agriculture is on the verge of a catastrophe.
Our deputies and senators will propose a number of emergency measures which, should prevent the eventual collapse of agriculture and further deterioration of the living standards in rural areas:
- Firstly: preferential credits to purchase means of production, particularly fertilizers and fuels;
- Secondly: preferential credits for concrete modernization projects on the farms and for their adjustment to market economy;
- Thirdly: protection of our agriculture against food imports, particularly when food is subsidized by foreign exporters;
- Fourthly: expansion and greater flexibility of intervention purchases of produce, by reforming, among others, the organization and operation of the Agency of Agricultural Market;
Fifthly: animated exports of produce and foodstuffs, mainly to eastern markets.

Ho ever, in the long run Polish agriculture needs deep structural change. We opt for an active participation of the state in the evolutionary transformation of agriculture. He state should:
- promote the development of infrastructure in the countryside,
i.e., to expand agricultural services, trade, construct new roads and to develop telecommunications. 
- subsidize health care and welfare services promote culture and education
- improve the real property trade by facilitating accumulation of land; 
prevent rapid price hikes of agricultural machinery and fertilizers by offering cheap credits and credit preferences for their manufacturers.
Our view is that the structural transformation of Poland's agriculture does not need to entail the liquidation of small family farms. It is the duty of the state to direct them towards a modern intensive agricultural production and breeding.
Our deputies will opt for the development of a multi-sector agriculture, free trade with land and free flow of people and capital between those sectors/They will advocate that state and co-operative farms are offered prospects of structural transformation without any political or administrative pressure/They oppose a policy as a result of which 2 and a half million people working in this sector of agriculture are uncertain about their future.
Poland must spare no effort in protecting its environment
We shall advance initiatives and support any legal and economic measures that promote sustainable development, which means that economic growth goes side by side with the protection of the environment and its resources in order to guarantee proper conditions of life and development
We opt for an active taxation policy, such state subsidies and credits which will bring about the production of equipment that will serve environmental protection.
We shall opt for monitoring the allocation of resources obtained as a result of eco-conversion.
- SOCIAL SAFETY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE
While opting for the -social market economy we focus on man, his situation, aspirations, needs and concern. We are of the opinion that no economic program e should give purely economic goals precedence over the social goals.
We cannot accept that the social policy merely amounts to charity measures for the unemployed and hungry
We support such a social policy which will rest on the principles of social justice and guarantee equitable access to education, culture, recreation, health care and welfare service we shall defend the social rights of our citizens. To the question where to get the money we respond with another question: where to get the money to cover up the consequences of the lack of social policy and the deplorable health condition, low education and culture of our citizens?
The right to work and social safety
Universal right to employment and to a decent pay reflecting the quality of work -these are the main tasks before any social policy.
Unemployment brings irreparable harms on man and they are not only economic; it also affects his personality, family life and is a danger to the stability of the state.
Our parliamentary deputies will therefore advocate an active policy of economic growth that will be as safeguard against mass scale unemployment that will create new job offer broad opportunities of vocational training or retraining and will give preferences to school graduates, the disabled, single parents and single providers for their families
We shall fight for the following issues which are very important to the working people:
- a reform of pension schemes that will guarantee at least a social minimum, liquidation of the old retirement and disability pensions: regular indexation of benefits and a free choice of insurance schemes;
- a major break through in housing construction/We propose our own concept of an efficient solution to that problem which involves mortgage credits and the development of municipal housing for the poorest;
- The legal protection of the rights of tenants;
- Reorganization of the health care system which will ensure full access to health care and financing of medical services and drugs by social insurance schemes. Health care cannot be open to the


competition of market forces, and in emergency cases it should not be the rich who will solely benefit from the health care system A profound reform should aim at overcoming the existing inefficiency of the health system and preventing further depreciation of assets and medical equipment;
- a reform of the national educational system so that it meets the requirements of modern times and ensures general access to free education in public schools; 
- legislative guarantees for the development an promotion of culture and its protection against commercialization;
- special social funds that will check the continuing decrease of the number of people who can afford family holidays or summer vacations for their children;
- complex tackling of the problems faced g the disabled. Equality of women
The society's attitude to women is one of the measures of democracy. We support the struggle waged by women organizations that more and more frequently voice their disagreement with the restraints imposed on their vital opportunities and with violations of equal rights. 
We opt for:
- the protection of women's rights on the labour market, and particularly the protection of single mothers against unemployment;
- the rights of women to an earlier retirement/
- the promotion of a variety of services and social funds which should be earmarked to help families and children;
- a political promotion of women who want to take an active part in public life.
We oppose the abortion ban/f parliament has again placed this issue on "its agenda, our deputies will propose a general referendum on the abortion law. At the same time we shall demand that the government prepare a programme of sexual education in order to minimize the number of abortions.
Equal opportunities for the younger generation at the start of their professional life.
Our parliamentary representatives will demand the right of equal opportunities that younger people should enjoy the beginning of their independent life and the start of their careers. 
We are against any commercialization ' of education which is the saddest token of social crisis shall firmly defend equal access to education.
Younger people cannot be I ft to themselves when they start searching for jobs after graduation There is a need for a separate state policy that will prevent the unemployment of the young
We support an active housing policy pursued by the state which will offer the majority of younger people prospects for their own apartments.
We are also of the opinion that young people should be offered greater chances to show their initiative and enterprise, and the most talented of them - prospects of rapid professional and social promotion

- STATE SECURITY AND SOVEREIGNTY - A COMMON CONCERN OF ALL POLES
Poland's foreign policy should be guided by two goal: it should guarantee Poland's security and inviolability of frontiers and promote beneficial cooperation with other countries
Here are the priorities of that policy that will be endorsed by our deputies:
- partner like relations with all the states. Of utmost importance are our contacts with our neighbours, and particularly with the Soviet Union (as well as new states that have emerged along our eastern border) and with Germany. 
The process of Polish-German reconciliation that as recently been initiated should be accompanied by a changed concept of our Eastern policy which so far has been unclear and ineffective (we should bring about the reconciliation with our Eastern neighbours and prepare a treaty that will normalize our relations with them);
Poland's participation in the construction of the European security system in keeping with the OSCE principles Active participation in tie shaping of a new political order in Central and Eastern Europe; the establishment of beneficial to Poland and which
-covering the area from the Atlantic Ocean to the Urals without limiting it solely: to the EC countries; new regional strategic ties that will be are indispensable now that the CMEA and Poland's participation in the all-European process of integration the Warsaw Pact no longer exist;

- providing citizens with opportunities of broad contacts, "Cultural and scientific exchanges which are so important if we are to shape the future of Europe;
- fostering closer contacts with foreigners of Polish extraction. Apart from the economic strength and political alliances decisive about the state's security is its army, its military personnel and modern equipment.
We shall advocate supplying the army with indispensable resources so that it can discharge its defensive and educational functions in order to enhance its public image.
We shall opt for a gradual shortening of military service and transformation of our armed forces into a regular army.
 We think that Polish raison d'etre, it foreign policy and protection of the country should unite all Poles.)They should never be used for narrow political interests and as an instrument in political disputes. 
This parliamentary election should run under a motto of free choice and democracy. We hope that the atmosphere during the election campaign will correspond with this motto and will be marked by a respect for the rules of democratic political culture. This atmosphere is possible provided all political parties renounce hatred and obstinacy; refrain from accusations and cheap demagoguery. The parties that compete in this election should try to win the support of the electorate by formulating clear programmes It is in this spirit that the Alliance `of the Democratic Left intends to pursue its campaign.)
      At the very outset of the campaign some political forces, particularly those of the right, have permeated its atmosphere with intolerance ' and hatred and they resort to defamation and abuse.
      The response of the Alliance is: we shall not follow that path and we shall not be forced to embark on. We are convinced that the voters will make their own assessment (Polish society opts for stability and peace and shuns political adventurism.
So we turn to all voters: 
       It is up to us if this parliamentary election is an hour of truth about Poland's politics. Let us not get misguided by demagoguery and empty declarations. Let us not listen to those who fan the fire, call for genuine problems of this country) May the real value of the programmes and the qualifications of candidates decide. This is how we will know what support various political orientations have/
      We turn to those voters to who close is the election programme of the Democratic Left: 
      Do not stand apart! Take an active part in this election! Take your election decision by choosing parliamentary deputies who from now on will express your will, adopt a new progressive constitution, and in keeping with it, will exert their impact on the state policies
      We opt for an independent, sovereign just Poland, free from poverty and unemployment. It is for This Poland that we shall spare none of our efforts and opportunities
