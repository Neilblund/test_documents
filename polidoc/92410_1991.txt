THE DEMOCRATIC UNION
POLITICAL PLATFORM
Adopted at the Unification Congress, May 1991

- BLUEPRINT OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM	  
	
- THE STATE AS THE COMMON GOOD
The Democratic Union considers the independent Polish state with the Republican political system and democratic government as the superior value of the social order.	
We consider the state as the common good of all the citizens the notion of common good Ls
fundamental significance for us, so that if the state is the corn n good then it belongs to all people and not to one social group or political formation The people, that is the political community of the citizens, exercises the sovereign power in state by means Of general electric and referenda e republican political system and democratic institutions arid procedures and therefore the implication of the principle of the common good.
		

The Republic of Poland is the common good and therefore it should constitute the object of concern of all the members of the political community! Hence we postulate the responsibility for the state For this reason the Democratic Union will not engage in the political struggle in the forms which might do harm to the authority of the institutions of the state also why the Democratic Union will pursue the politics of constant reconciliation of particular interests with the common interest.  

The strength and the authority of the state can be built only on the foundation of law  content and the manner of passing of the Polish Constitution, which is the foundation of la should be such as to provide the Constitution with general approval.

- THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES
	
The freedom of the individual must be recognized and protected by the state. We put our  in the creative and beneficial power of freedom,, which makes it possible for the individuals participate freely and responsibly in determining their own fate and  above all that of political community, that is their own state.
	
- The protection of freedom is guaranteed by law. Therefore the legal system must not be determined in an arbitrary way. Stable and generally comprehensible- law must protect bas human liberties.
	

 
The political system of the state should serve the development the society of free citizen This is why we adhere to the concept of the auxiliary role of the state No political system not even the democratic state, is free from the temptation to expand its powers excessively: The Democratic Union believes that state institutions should perform exclusively those functions which cannot be accomplished by citizens, local communities, professional and economic associations:
The Democratic Union supports full rights for ethnic and religious minorities, which exists in the Polish state. The state should guarantee the minorities e right to the self- determination at their education, cultural life and participation in public life.

- THE DECENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT
The civil state is a decentralized state. The emphasize decentralization, because there exist political systems which are both democratic and centralized The Democratic Union believes that the state needs the institution of local government. The independent local government performs its duties more efficiently than central organs of state administration It also promotes day-to-day participation of citizens in public life.


The state should be strong with the strength of its local communities. This is why the Democratic Union intends to contribute to the establishment of local government, which is simply Ai decentralized form of state power/


The decentralization of the state requires the existence of a multi-level and non-hierarchical government. Large regions with powers and real ability to arty out economic policies constitute significant elements of the decentralized government Today's Europe becomes a community of regions.
The Democratic Union is willing to participate in the process of the natural emergence Poland of such the political system which conforms to the contemporary European  standards such a future-oriented solution receives further justification from the concept of market economy as the model of the economic system for Poland In market economy it is impossible to  conduct the same economic policy in different parts of the country with distinct geographic as well as socio-economic conditions; different regions of Poland require different policies.
We consider the one-level local government which exists in Poland at the present as the first step towards a decentralized political system; the first step is not enough. A change of the financial system of the local government is urgently needed, so that communities could fulfil its legally prescribed functions the same time many powers of the organs of the state administration need to be transferred to local communities.

 The Democratic Union also stands for the gradual liquidation of the over developed special field branches of the central administration, which are but a remnant of the centralized government and which cannot be reconciled with the idea of the decentralized and self-governing political system.

However, we oppose an over-hasty and centrally-imposed administrative reform of the state. It should not pose a threat to the badly needed stability of state structures	is domain requires a long term and organic process of changes.
	
- THE LIMITATION AND THE DIVISION OF POWER 
All public power in the Republic of Poland must be limited. We put particular emphasis on this principle since even the democratic state is not free from the tendency to amass excessive power in one of its organs. Law sets limits to all governments. The Democratic Union demands that each public institution. Poland have its powers defined by law and that its actions be strictly limited to those provided for by the proper legal acts. 
The division and mutual balance offer should be observed particularly in the relationship, between the parliament and the president. This is why the new, democratically elected parliament, should be a strong parliament that is the one which will not only perform its legislative functions but also be, able to participate to effectively in the establishment of the government on the equal  footing with the president.




The parliamentary democracy requires that the current policies of the state be burdened an organ which is politically accountable, at is the one which can be dismissed at any month the result of incorrect policy making. It is the government which is such an organ responsibility for certain policies requires the effective ability to determine them. Therefore Democratic Union believes it necessary to provide the government with the autonomy determining the current state policy and to define clearly the degree of the admissible intervening of both the parliament and the president. Especially the politically unaccountable administrative of the presidential office must not take over the powers of the parliament nor intervene directly day-to-day activities of the governments.


- THE ROLE OF THE PARLIAMENT IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM


The Democratic Union considers the parliament to be the fundamental institution of the rule the people in the democratic system. This is because the power of the parliaments is legitimate the general elections and at the same time it is the parliament which as a collective body reflects the plurality of views, interests and pursuits of the society. The democratic articulation of popular will is possible only in the course of confronting different opinions and seeking political compromise.

	
While recognizing the importance of the representative parliament for the democratic governmental process, we are far from making representative system the absolute principle. The political significance of the parliament depends on its ability to make decisions. The division within the parliament, if excessive, constitute an obstacle to effective decision making. This is why the Sejm electoral law should encourage the creation of strong political bodies, which would democratic able to attract sizeable constituencies.

The Sejm in the first place exercises legislative power, whereby it determines the legal order. The Sejm should also take part, together with the president; in avoid the establishment and dismissal of the government, as well as keep the government accountable. Our aim is to avoid two types of error The first error is the diminution of the role of the Sejm result of an ill-conceived electoral law o an excessive growth of presidential powers The second error consists in the take over by the Sejm of the powers which belong to the government ("ruling parliament").

We are in favour of the preservation of the second chamber of the parliament. There is a need for the chamber of "reflection and prudence" as a permanent feature of the Polish political system.
Its political function is to provide a possibility to correct the decisions of the Sejm, to consider the quality of the laws, and especially to decrease the influence of political contingencies on the content of the legislation. 
The Senate, while fulfilling these functions; must not be engaged in the on-going political struggle. The powers and election procedures of the Senate should be compatible with its nature. Hence the Senate must not deal with current policies, neither should it if have powers to establish, dismiss and control the government. Its powers should regard legislative activities (amending the laws and initiating new legislation); believe that the Sejm and the Senate should be elected on the basis of different procedures. The higher chamber could be partly elected in the indirect way, for example, by local governments.	

- THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC

The Democratic Union favours the political system in which the president is responsible for the state and not for the realization of any particular policy/In such a system the president personifies the authorize .of the state, guarantees the stability and consistency of the activities of the state organs. The president, whose power comes from the will of the majority of the electorate, and not from the support of a single political force, and who enjoys the privilege of political unaccountability during his term of office, should be above political divisions and should not be involved in current disputes between political groups.
 
However, the president should possess constitutional powers to protect effectively the constitutional order, to ensure the continuity of foreign and def nee policies as well as to arbitrate 
the disputes which threaten to disrupt the activities of the state In such emergency situations, the  president should be granted, though in a rationally limited degree, the power to dissolve the 7 parliament The Democratic Union proposes that this domain should be connected with the ;personal .presidential  should be clearly defined by the Constitution and which would snot: he, countersignature of the cabinet and thus would not be accountable to the parliament All other presidential acts should require to be countersigned by the proper member t of the Council of Ministers.

- The PRIME MINISTER AND THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS


 The constitutional status of the government should reconcile the demand for the stability and efficiency of the executive power with the principle of 'deal accountability of the government to the Sejm, which is the basis of parliamentary democracy. The president should nominate the prime minister and on his motion - the other members the Council of Ministers. However, the establishment of the government and the continuation of its activities must be made dependent upon n the confidence of the parliamentary majority.

The Democratic Union supports the introduction into the new Constitution of the Republic of Poland of the procedures would strengthen the prime minister and his government in ill respect of the parliament. We believe it necessary to introduce the constructive vote of: non-confidence which requires that, in order to dismiss the government, a new candidate for the
prime minister needs to receive the support of a parliamentary majority-The prime minister should also have the power to combine a legislative initiative with the motion for the vote of confidence for the government as well as the principle of the collective responsibility of the
As ministers regard the legal Acts which the government considers particularly urgent, the legislative procedures should give priority to the drafts submitted by the government. 

- THE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE

The Democratic Union supports the reforms which, in accordance with the principle of the division of power, have brought about the independence of the judiciary. We believe that the Principle of independence of both judges and courts should be constitutionally guaranteed. Powers of the judiciary in respect to the head of state and the state administration should not be diminished. This concerns especially the place of the National Judiciary Council within the Polish political system.
 
	
The only way for Poland to leave behind the remnants of the totalitarian political system through the transformation of the whole legal system, including the Constitution the acts if parliament and governmental regulations. This should lead to the complete overcoming of the main faults of the communist legal system: phoney legal institutions, fictions legal form (where democratic jargon serves to conceal the actual content of law), detailed legal provisions excessively repressive laws.

	
As far as the penal policy is concerned, we demand that the persons who have committed crimes be inescapably brought to justice. The punishment should constitute the necessary unavoidable outcome of a crime. At the same time the state should strictly observe the principle whereby no person whose guilt as not been proved can be punished by law. The Democratic Union approves of no exceptions as regards this principle.
	

- THE STATE AND THE CHURCH
	
The Democratic Union comprises people of different worldviews and religious convictions.
Democratic Litho intends to conduct its activities in accordance with the principles determined Christian values. The Democratic Union intends to promote the respect for these values in public life.	

The Democratic Unit stands for the mutual recognition of independence of the institutions the state and the Church. The state should constitute the common good of all the citizens. It can be appropriated by any group of people subscribing to a particular ideology or a worldview. The state should safeguard the rights of every citizen.
	


At the same time the Democratic Union stands for the collaboration of the institutions of the state and the church The Democratic Union fully supports the participation of religious institutions in the public is and social life, in as much as this participation derive from the nature of such institutions We attach particular significance to the public and social activities of the Roman Catholic Chu which used to have and still has a considerable influence on the attitudes of the Polish people We wish to promote in our country mutual tolerance of beliefs and culture of the public life. 

ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND ECONOMIC POLICY

- GENERAL OUTLINE	

- The Democratic Union aims to win dense of those voters who estimate soberly the possibilities and perspectives of our country. We turn to the Poland of reason, he one which is determined to direct her activities towards the realization of common good. The Democratic Unions is not a party which appeals to a particular class or a social group nor is it based on a particular ideology.
Poland is not an area of economic disaster and chaos but, on the contrary, the very place in Central Europe where the difficult but necessary economic restoration has been undertaken with exceptional -courage and determination. The sacrifices which we have had to make are the necessary price -of the reform. We have already come a long way, so let us proceed further as rationally possible, respecting the laws of economics and without wasting what we have achieved so fat.
 From the economic point of view Poland is an underdeveloped country. This is the result of the last forty yearns of an irrational economic system which made our economy a few times less efficient, than that of the countries of Western Europe, and our incomes a few times smaller than those in the West. Affluence can be achieved only through many years of persistent effort to improve the organization on and quality of law, and to build market institutions, stable currency as well as privatized and open economy.

- STABLE CURRENCY

 The Democratic Union believes that a currency table current constitutes an indispensable foundation of the efficient and competitive economy. The Polish zloty must become a strong currency, one which does not diminish in value, which fulfils equivalent in sought for goods and services, and which is worth earning, saving and investing. This is why we support:
- consistent and trustworthy anti inflationary policy, which would give citizens and companies the guarantees of economic security; its aim Should be to bring the pace of price increases down to the level which is comparable to that of the countries of Western Europe within the next two three years.

-  stable monetary policy, conducted by the National Bank of Poland in full independence of the central government; real money comes from work, which creates national wealth, and not from  the mint; printing empty money is a public counterfeit.

— interest rates freely determined on the monetary market as the equilibrium price, in the  conditions of the competition of banks for depositors and borrowers; however, as far as housing and agriculture are concerned, we favour interest rates beneath the market level, the difference , to be subsidized from the state budget. We realize that high interest rates slow down the economic progress, yet only when inflation is under control, will there arise conditions for the restoration of investment credits with favourable interest rates; neglecting these principles can only result in the resurgence of inflation.

- realistic approach to the rate of exchange of the Polish currency against other, currencies- the rate of exchange should be relatively stable due to the internal strength of the zloty; administratively stabilized rate of exchange cannot be a substitute of the stable monetary policy and balanced budget.

	
- SOUND PUBLIC FINANCES	 

The state cannot spend more than it receives from tax-payers. The level of public spending should be similar to that of the majority of market economies. This means that the state should fund basic public services, invest in the infrastructure necessary for technological and economic progress, and provide social security up to a level which would not remove incentives for work and entrepreneurship.


The Democratic Union stands for:

- balanced budget, i.e. sound finances of the state; 

- rational level of the participation of the state budget in the national income(up to the level of about 30 per cent); a higher level of public spending entails the need for high progressive taxation which poses the threat of economic stagnation and rising inflation; the Democratic Union sees the possibility of decreasing the share of the state budget in the national income through cuts in public spending, especially in the expenditure for the state administration and what follows  through the decrease of direct taxation;

— the fastest possible implementation of the tax system reform; the Democratic Unions believe that the future taxation system should be stable, understandable, just in the distribution of the public spending. 
Encouraging economic activity, and comparable to the system existing in other European countries, the Democratic Union supports the introduction on Values Added Tax (VAT) as of the beginning in of 1992 we deem it necessary to replace the turnover which is complicated and inefficient; we also support the introduction of the personal tax which will replace five different taxes on Wages and incomes We believe that the person income tax which constitutes a significant part of the state and communal incomes will heighten the economic awareness of citizens and thus encourage their interest in the economical public spending objective system of funding of local governments which would enable flexible and independent economic policies of local communities.



- ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR
	
The Democratic Union and its parliamentary presentation will support and initiate the legislation removing all obstacles to entrepreneurship. This requires a change of the folio .1 issues: the provisions concerning the issue of permissions for undertaking economic active :di( tax system; the outdated employment la the pr visions of the law on constructing development and planning land management the housing law; he sanitary law provisions; etc.	
The Democratic Union will aim at the introduction of firm constitutional and legal guarantees for private property.


- The role of the state in the creation of favourable conditions for the development of private enter rise cannot be reduced to that of the guardian of the rule of the market; to state must also support the development of education, science and technology, and take steps in order to improve  the infrastructure of the economy.
- The participation of local governments in the development of the restructuring and training pro creates more favourable conditions for the undertaking of economic activity by individuals such 'programs need to be developed jointly by local governments and the central !rams administration, utilizing the resources which have to be provided by the state budget.

 The Democratic Union is firmly opposed to the conduct of commercial economic activities by local governments, which often contradicts the interests of private enterprise The communal  economic activity should be limited to providing basic communal services.

- The Democratic Union attaches particular significance to the development of modern banking and insurance system, the privatization of state banks and state insurance companies and the creation of the institutions of the capital market.	
- The development of private enterprise as well as the privatization of the state sector of the economy will create favourable conditions for the growth of the middle class, which the Democratic Union considers as a natural social basis of a stable market economy and a liberal-democratic state.

- FOREIGN CAPITAL

The Democratic Union adheres to the idea of open Poland as well as of Europe's openness to Poland. This is why we emphasize strongly the need for the presence of foreign companies in our country.

Such companies constitute a source of the capital which is lacking in Poland as well as advanced skills and technologies. They are also a bridge between Poland and world markets and may e the Polish economy more strength to expand across the borders in search of profits for all of us.  Therefore the Democratic Union, haying constantly the national interest as its point of reference, will aim at:

- gradual elimination of differences between the conditions for foreign and Polish capital and the adjustment of the Polish legal provisions regulating economic activity to international standards, and especially to those which exist in the countries of the European Community. The Democratic Union is opposed to any forms of discrimination of the foreign capital but on the other hand disapproves of any privileges, e.g. tax exemptions, for this sector of the economy;  

- securing stable legal and political conditions for foreign investors who purchase shares and stocks Polish companies as well as those who themselves initiate economic activities in Poland. We are convinced that for the Poles, it is a better solution to create new jobs in Poland with the help of foreign capital than to look for work abroad;

- granting foreign investors the right to the full repatriation of profits; 

	
- the abolishment of the present bureaucratic obstacles regarding undertaking of activities with the participation of foreign capital; in particular, the Democratic Union will eliminate the USD 50.000 minimum capital contribution, to limit the permission the few sectors of the economy which involve strategic national interests, to allow free access of shares and stocks of the companies with the participation of foreign capital; 

	

- the creation of favourable conditions for investing in the sectors of the economy and companies which in order to become competitive need the resources, beyond those of private and state investors; 

- encouraging investments in the regions particularly affected by unemployment in the production and the restructuring of the economy. 
	

- PRIVATIZATION	 
The reduction of the size of the state sector of the economy to the level characteristic of Economies are a condition of the increased efficiency, productivity and international competitive of our economy the result of which will be the growth of living standards. The Democratic sees no alternative to privatization which must constitute the mainstream of the long restructuring of the Polish economic system, even though it is not the panacea for a problem of our country. 

The Democratic Union stands for:  


- Economically efficient privatization, leading to the domination of companies 
or individual shareholders, who would be able to influence effectively. s the performance of their companies, as well as willing to risk their own capital and interested in profits; only then foundations will be laid for profitable and economically safe investment small shareholders;



- Privatization connected with the restructuring of the privatized companies and if possible with an inflow of additional capital
- the privatization with the participation of large sections of the society in the form of the community citizen share ownership program, whereby small savings could be utilized- and privatization the form of the employee ownership program in which personal financial means of employment could be utilized to purchase shares of their companies. e also support a limited scope of distribution of the state property with the use of privatization vouchers, carried out gradually and carefully, in such a way as not to create the conditions for a rise of inflation.
 


- creating a possibility of the privatization of communal companies as well as the continuation so-called small privatization in trade, Services, transportation, and others.
- the inclusion in the privatization program of state-owned farms in those cases where justified by the economic situation and the organizational preparedness of the farm necessary, to prepare a separate law concerning the privatization of state-owned farms in the specific aspects of these establishments would be recognized.
	

We believe that in the present, initial stage of privatization, there will be a significant role the so called liquidation privatization as well as for the establishment of new private companies the basis of the assets of bankrupt companies.

- The Democratic Union also supports assisting the privatization process with special credit arrangements are in favour of a prudent privatization, without neglecting the possible unemployment rise or other negative economic and social consequences. We are firmly against the pursuit of statistical effects regarding privatization, which might result in unnecessary tensions and illusory privatization.
 

The Democratic Union is against the general re privatization which may threaten the speed of the privatization process, become a potential source of serious social conflicts and trigger avalanche of demands beyond the financial abilities of the state. 
We are in favour of compelling in such cases where the compensation rules or the nationalization laws were violated. We also think it desirable to carry out, wherever possible, the in-kind restitution, which will rests in a rapid growth of the means of production in the hands of
- Concrete, individual owners whose property title is founded upon the new political and legal order. 
Such an owner, or an executive body he appoints will be strongly motivated to use his property in the most efficient manner, with good effects for the economy as a whole law order to avoid making privatization too complicated, a time limit should be set as regards  
- applying for compensation in general, as well as for specific objects. 

- THE STATE SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY

The Democratic Union believes that the conditions for a stable and effective conduct of economic activity should be created for the companies which will permanently or temporarily' remain state-owned public rhetoric against the state sector of the economy, only create bad atmosphere and deteriorate work motivation of both workers and managers. 
On the other `hand, in the light of the fact that state-owned companies will for many years remain a significant - albeit decreasing - part of the economy, it is necessary to restore for their employees a perspective of normal existence, which is to a large extent missing today.
It is one of the factors making the recession more severe and the economic behaviour of state companies inflexible. These companies should in the years come to contribute to the economic revival together with private companies and their employees should have an opportunity to be properly paid for efficient work. This is why the Democratic Union stands for the urgent development of an outline of the final scope and shape of the state sector in Poland. The progressive abolishment of differences in the conditions of the activity of private and public companies a significant acceleration of the liquidation of inefficient state companies, at the same time alleviating the social costs of the necessary restructuring the effective commercialization, that is subjection of state owned companies to the same economic and legal rules as those regarding private companies the management of such commercialized companies should be entrusted to investment banks or other trustees; the place of this process should be such as to ensure the political and social conditions needed for the companies to be run on truly profit-oriented principles;
- defining a clear perspective of the abolishment of the so called "popiwek" (tax for excessive wage "increases in state companies);



- granting the employees the right to participate through their elected representatives in the management of companies, however in a way which does not contradict the basic rights of the company's executive board and in accordance with the experience of the highly developed capitalist countries;


- The creation of institutional and procedural solutions so as to minimize conflict situations companies.
	


- The creation of motivation mechanisms which would make the management and the workers interested in long-term profits of the company and in preparing their companies for; quick privatization;
	
- The development of a privatization schedule in order to eliminate the sense of insecurity' and instability among both the management and the workers- the privatization privileges lie in management and the employees should be made dependent upon the economic situation of the company to be privatized is necessary to stop the deterioration of the economic position of companies before privatization.

Following the example of the countries with highly developed agriculture, the creation of legal and economic conditions for the stabilization of the state owned farms specializing in the production of high quality seeds and breeding animals, which constitute the supply basis of agriculture at large.

The Democratic Union also considers it necessary to rebuild radically the whole outdated industrial structure. We are against the determination by the government investment directions or artificial stimulation of selected sectors of production .Allocation decisions should be based upon objective information provided by the marks. It remains the governments task develop restructuring programs concerning the nationwide technical infrastructure, (railways roads, telecommunication) and coal and energy producing industries; the government should also be involved in initiating and assisting their restructuring. The Democratic Union believes that the security of the country’s energy supplies requires the rationalization of energy consumption and a differentiation of oil and natural gas supply.

- THE COOPERATIVE SECTOR

The Democratic Union estimates highly the Polish cooperative tradition which goes back nineteenth century, although it was impoverished during the last 45 years of centrally managed (state-owned economy). Genuine cooperatives in the areas of production, consumption, constitute a permanent and indiscriminate component. Of sp economy/The revival of the cooperative sector may contribute to the economic progress in our country, the overcoming of the recession and a reduction of unemployment particularly important the development of rural cooperatives which may contribute to the process of the abolition of the monopolies that continue to stifle the agriculture, as particularly important.

The Democratic Union stands for the acceleration of the legislative work on the new cooperative law which should adjust the conditions under which this sector operates to the requirements of market economy as well as to assist the cooperative movement on the local level. The Democratic Union also supports the legislative initiative that would en le the transformation of some cooperatives into companies based on the commercial code. At the same time the Democratic Union is firmly against the re-establishment of cooperative unions as well as other types of the bureaucratic superstructure in the cooperative sector. 

AGRICULTURE

Agriculture policies should aim at stabilizing the conditions under which the farmers conduct economic activity and at compensating for the degree of economic risk taken in and outside agriculture significant.
In the years to come one of significant problems of the Polish agriculture will be the restructuring on the farming sector. Contrary to other sectors of the national economy, where a degree of concentration is needed, agriculture policy should encourage, in a reasonable degree, and concentration. The restructuring of the farming sector should be a natural rather than an administratively enforced process, with full respect for property rights and the freedom of choice.).
The same time the Democratic Union stands firmly for the inviolability of the property titles that he fanners acquired in the result of the land reform]
	
The Democratic Union believes that the restructuring of the farming sector should be connected with a promotion of the development of economic activities outside agriculture in the rural areas of the country, in particular as regards the food-processing industry) On the one hand, this will result in the creation of additional jobs for people saving agriculture, and — on the other
hand it will improve the services for the farming sector.


The Democratic Union also supports the concentration of the economic assistance of the state, part from the restructuring of the farming sector, on the development of the technical, technological and social infrastructure in the rural areas, which would contribute to an increase of productivity of agriculture and reduce the discontents of rural life and work;



The Democratic Union believes that the necessary integration of Poland with the West,-, European Agricultural market requires the negotiation of transitory and readjustment solutions.

HOUSING

Housing shortages constitute one of the most serious social and economic problems of our country. Unfortunately, in this area there are no fast and easy solutions). A thorough reform and restructuring	of the housing sector must take at least three to four years. The present system of the organization and funding of the housing sector as well as the housing economy have totally collapsed and all attempts to sustain them are futile'

The possible solutions of the housing shortage should be sought in the improvement of the situation and the performance standards in the housing industry. To achieve significant progress in this area, credits made available by Polish banks and savings of Polish citizens will not suffice; what is needed is the foreign assistance in the form of both funds -and technology.

- Facilitating the purchase and sale of the land for development and simplifying the provision of concerning development planning, land protection, construction laws, etc. the introduction of a clear system of the commercial housing exchange based upon mark principle; when flats become commercial goods, this will result in the reduction of rents in these few flats which are today rented on market principles. 

- more rational use of the housing space by the persons whose flats are bigger than their needs.
	

- making house and flat owners interested in the proper maintenance of their property,

- motivate entrepreneurs to build houses with flats for sale or to be let

The Democratic Union believes that at the same time when the housing sector turns to market principles, it is necessary to create such legal solute	which would provide the protection of tenants from the arbitrary decisions of house owners. The Democratic Union also finds its necessary create a system of financial assistance for the people who are building or buying their first flat. Such assistance must be given directly to the concerned individuals and made dependent upon: their income level and the housing standards they are offered. It is also necessary to provide:; targeted assistance for the people who find it difficult to meet their housing costs This form of assistance should r place the present day unconditional subsidizing of, rents, credits, hot water supply heating etc Also the problem of the upgrading and refunding of housing deposits from the budget must be tackled within the next few years. 


 
- THE PROTECTION OF THE INTERESTS OF THE SOCIETY IN THE COURSE OF THE ECONOMIC REFORMS.	  
While supporting the growth of free enterprise, the strengthening of the market, mechanism and to privatization of the economy, the Democratic Union believes it is also necessary for the state to Tate legal solutions providing protection against the abuses of economic freedom which may arm to major social interests Thus the Democratic Union stands in particular for the protection of consumers' interests and the creation of the legal foundation of the enforcement; such protection should regard the health and safety of consumers the prohibition of misleading advertising etc., but not prices which must be determined by the market.

The modernization of the labour law in such a way as to, on the one hand, protect the basic interests of the employees from the arbitrary decisions of the employers, and, on the other hand; to allow for a flexible labour. market and the protection of the economy and the society from the effects of illegal protests seed strikes dynamic de monopolization of the economy and the improvement of the  antimonopoly, legislation, together with granting more powers to the Anti-Monopoly Office.  


ECOLOGY

The state policy concerning ecology must be based, upon the technological progress in which the -:`environmental resources are permanently sustained This requires the evaluation of the needs of r the present and the future generations as well as preventive policies like the application of the environment friendly technologies.

The main actions must be directed towards:
- rationalization of the energy production and consumption; 
the restructuring of the industry, especially the energy-producing and steel industries; the reduction of the transportation-related pollution and a decrease of the exhaustion of fumes as a condition of the development of motor transportation well as a gradual assumption of reforms of the European Community and the preferences for the public transportation;

- the rationalization of the exploitation of water resources by the industry, agriculture and individual consumers. 

- the creation of a consistent' ecological system of protected regions, including national parks, reservations etc.

The environmental protection system must be adjusted to the whole process of the systemic transformation. This calls for:

- A change, in the environmental management and funding systems towards greater regionalization and decentralization.
This cannot violate the principle that it is not the state budget but environmental polluters that should bear the hulk of costs of fighting pollution.

- The Modernization of the laws on the environmental protection, water resources, forests and development planning.  

- The enforcement of the provisions of the environmental protection law through the creation of the "ecological police", which would be independent of the local authorities.


- Supporting the system of social non-governmental initiatives, groups and organizations which are active in the field of environmental protection in Poland.

- The Democratic Union considers the elimination of health and life perils on the areas affected r, by ecological disaster as one of the most urgent tasks. 

- THE ECONOMY OPEN TO THE WORLD

Poland should be a country which is widely open to Europe and to the world, not only political hut also economically The Democratic Union stands firmly for:

- liberal trade policies, that is low customs tariffs and the elimination of administration restrictions in import and export; high customs tariffs limit the benefits of international exchange, protection of the monopolies within Poland, increase prices on the Polish market, decrease economical progress and make the national economy less competitive on international markets, liberal customs policy should be accompanied by a rational protection of Polish manufactures which need to readjust to the world market requirements; 

- Dynamic negotiations aimed at the removal of customs and quantitative restriction of other countries towards Polish exporters for the strengthening and expansion of the convertible Polish currency. 

- The acceleration of the negotiations of the treaty on the association of Poland with the Euro Economic Community and at a later time the full membership of our country in the EEC.
- The rebuilding of trade and economic relationships between Poland and the Soviet Union on the basis of market principles and mutual benefits; the elimination of the present stalernate,4:th trade with our Eastern neighbour is of utmost importance for the overcoming of the recession it the Polish economy. 
The assistance and credits that Poland receives from international financial institutions are also very significant for the global economic development. 
Once her economic condition allows her to do so; Poland should participate in the development programs directed towards the Third World countries up to the level determined by our future economic performance.


THE NEW MODEL OF SOCIAL POLICY

THE AIMS OF SOCIAL POLICY
The Democratic Union considers the main aim of social policy to moderate the conflict between e-market determined distribution of goods and moral, social and cultural values.

 Social policies of the economic transition should co-determine the shape of the economic reform and provide citizens with the needed protection from the most severe effects of the economic transition. This is what constitutes the social dimension of the market economy. It is a necessary task. In the situation of diminishing welfare responsibilities of both companies and the state, there is a growing role for local communities, labour unions and non-governmental associations for mutual assistance, as well as for private foundations. The goal of those institutions is to diminish the gap between the organized and beneficiary’s social assistance. The social policy which we support should deal in advance with the emerging problems.

While observing the principle of equality of all citizens, the social policy of the state should make it possible for alt the persons able and willing to work to obtain employment or self-employment.

- ensure a proper, freely negotiated salary and sale conditions of work and the working time which would allow for family life, proper rent, and the participation in public and cultural life; senior citizens with decent living conditions.

- Protect from poverty those who cannot work due to health problems and other reasons.
- be committed to disease prevention and provide the access to health ensure equal opportunity in the access to education and equal starting point for children and youngsters.

- ensure general access to reliable information and to culture

- The proposed model of social policy assigns particular importance to the family. This priority has influenced specific solutions in all the questions under consideration.

- PROBLEMS OF EMPLOYMENT, WAGES AND INCOME

The Democratic Union supports a model of Tabor relations based on negotiations of the labour: regulate only the minimum rights and maximum duties of employees!
Annual consultations on the national level between the organizations of employees, employers and the government should lead to agreements concerning current income policies. We believe that at the single most significant factor reducing structural and temporary unemployment is the stimulation of private enterprise. The creation of good conditions for the establishment and, development of companies is therefore the basic talk of the state as regards fighting unemployment.)Loca1 upsurges of unemployment should be countered with regions' structuring and training programs. Such programs should be jointly developed by local authorities and the state administration\

As far as the important question of unemployment among school and university is concerned, the Democratic Union will aim at the establishment of credit lines for the commencement of economic activity and scholarships for the acquisition of further education system of unemployment compensation must be constructed in such a way as to encourage commencement of employment and to prevent unjustified reception of unemployment. The proper definition of the relationship between the minimum age and the unemployment benefit constitutes a significant factor in fighting unemployment. This relationship should be negotiated by the state administration, labour unions and employers' association; with possible regional differences. 

Work will only become a respected good if employers begin to organize it properly, providing sale and decent working conditions. The Democratic Union will pursue the system of labour protection based upon international norms yet free from the temptation to curtail employees’ rights in the pursuit of higher profits.

Accordingly, we believe it necessary to: 

-gradually abolish tax limits imposed upon wage establish rational minimum wage which, on the one hand, would protect the employees’ interests and, on the other hand, would not interfere with the wage structure and increase unemployment. 

	
- keep the balance between the wages in the public sector and those in the market regulated economy.

— introduce a lenient progressive taxation system on personal income.	 


- SOCIAL 1NSURANCE AND BENEFITS

The Democratic Union stands for an essential reform of social insurance institutions and thus for granting the citizens more choice as regards the scope and forms of insurance. In the course of the reform one should look for a way of activating retirement funds for the sake of privatization and economy.

The Democratic Union supports the establishment of private insurance companies yet it believes that it is the state that should remain the ultimate guarantee of social insurance.
We stand for the compensation of the injustices that have arisen in this area in the past (the so called “old portfolio”). This calls for new, extremely urgent legal provisions to introduce a uniform system of the conditions of retirement pension eligibility.	

Not only the mother but also the father of the child should be eligible for the parental and upbringing allowance. In the future all the persons raising a child should be eligible for the upbringing allowance and 811 the children should be granted equal rights as far as the family allowance is concerned. 	

The social welfare system should consists of a network of cooperating governmental as well as Unity, church and private agency Assistance of different types should reach the people who have found themselves in need due to their particularly difficult situation, illness, disability, lack of employment opportunities, extreme poverty, helplessness, alcohol or drug addiction/'

The Democratic Union will actively support the development of the social welfare system, its proper organization and professional level.'"

- PROBLEMS OF THE DISABLED
112e. Democratic' Union believes that the mainstream of the activities directed towards the 'disabled is to enable them to participate fully in the social life, to overcome their isolation and to provide opportunities for employment and education on all levels.
We support the organizational solutions and assistance for the purchase of the facilities and the equipment needed for the disabled e state assistance for the disabled should also involve the ••provision of the architectural and construction norms in which the needs of the disabled are taken into consideration
HEALTH SERVICE
The Democratic Union adheres to the principle that the basic health care should not he dependent on the financial situation of a person. Therefore we support the full access to the health service for everyone, without any conditions and privileges.	This implies that the basics form of health should be the properly organized public health service within the responsibility of the state.

We postulate the restructuring of the health insurance system, the preservation of compulsory basic health insurance, the cost of which be show equally shared by the society, and the development of private above-basic health insurance e health service reform should lead to f the equality of the provisions for the public, private and cooperative sector, to the privatization of some health care units and to the effective functioning of the public health service.


It is necessary to broaden preventive health-care activities and to introduce a comprehensive monitoring of the environmental pollution as a precondition f taking effective countermeasures.

- EDUCATION
The Democratic Union supports the educational reform which was initiated in 1989 and believes that it should be continued. t has resulted in the decrease of the administrative control of education and the elimination of-'indoctrination indoctrination from the school curriculum, the present Moment the main purpose of the educational policies of the state should be a general and full access to a pluralistic and increasingly autonomous educational system. The most urgent current affront is to conduct the neglected reform of vocational schools which must change their nature and provide the youth with the opportunities of further development as well as useful, modern professional skills.
 
The state should not impose the uniformity of the educational system. The legal framework and. the system of funding should encourage the development of private and community schools; in which different views and needs of the students, parents and teachers would be taken into consideration Such schools should also receive support from public funds on the level identification with the average public financial contribution for the education of one student. 
The teacher training system requires an essential reform. Two-year teacher course meet to be abolished and replaced with undergraduate teacher colleges in which lectures are given by university teachers and which enable the graduates to continue their education on the university level}

State schools should provide the parents with the opportunity to educate their children according to their religious beliefs, the right to which is guaranteed by the international law.
This implies the d to give access to classrooms for facultative teaching of religion of all denominations It is the duty of the state to ensure that the teaching of religion does' not crate  -the members of school community - parents, teachers, students - a conflict of conscience on discrimination. Non-state schools should be free to decide the content and form of the teaching of religion or to abandon it altogether.

- CULTURE	
	
The Democratic Union believes that state authorities should protect the right of citizens to choose freely between cultural values the conditions of the social impoverishment,	total commercialization of culture would in vitally lead to the violation of this right Thus we believe that before new forms of patronage are developed, the state support of culture must be preserved. State and local governments must still fund public libraries, undertake the consideration of historical monuments, maintain museums and promote artistic events of a prominent and permanent value. At the same time enterprises in the sphere of culture should strive towards financial self- sufficiency as well as attempt to provide tangible indications of 'their- public usefulness; this would constitute a basis for supporting them from public funds as well as encourage the very desirable development of non-state patronage


- POLISH FOREIGN POLICY

The fundamental purpose of foreign policy is to safeguard the independence of the state, to eliminate outside threats and to take advantage of the opportunities for material, culture and e, spiritual progress that arise from the contacts and relations with other nations as well as the opportunities for the strengthening of the position of our country in the international community.

The problem of our position between Russia and Germany bas been dominating Polish politics for, along time and it has re-asserted itself again in the moment when Poland is regaining its independence and rebuilding its democracy. By negotiating the treaty concerning the L' Polish-German border, the Mazowiecki government made a significant progress towards the  
The removal of any doubts questioning the territorial integrity of Poland. Thus propitious con conditions have been created for the establishment of new relations with the democratic Germany At the present moment it is a matter of utmost importance to take advantage of the opportunity of the direct neighbourhood with a democratic state which has a huge economic potential and which fully integrated into the European Community It should be the purpose of the Polish foreign )policy to k make the good neighbourhood with Germany a vehicle of our economic development and the integration with the European institutions far as the relationships between the Soviet Union and the independent states which emerge there of are concerned we have to combine firm adherence to principles with tactical flexibility The Polish interest demands that, once Fact Germany ceased to, Poland must not remain the Western forefront' of the political presence of is why the prompt withdrawal of the Soviet empire such a development would delay our integration with the democratic Europe.
This is why the prompt withdrawal of the Soviet Union from Poland remains a necessity. At the same time the remnants of the imperial structures - 
Warsaw Pact and the COMECON must be liquidated.

One must not forget that Russia will remain an important factor of international politics and one of the states co-determining the future of for region, irrespectively of what political shape will emerge from the present deep crisis Poland is bound with Russia with real interests: the security and economic cooperation, the opportunity of cultural presence and the needs of the large Polish community .Therefore we must not do anything that might alienate or humiliate this country We must not aim at pushing Russia away from Europe but, on the contrary, encourage their cooperation, the chances of which will increase if Russia gets rid of her imperial burden.
 
The policy of our state must unambiguously take into consideration and fully accept the aspirations of the nations within the Soviet Union towards independence. This, in the first place concerns our neighbours Lithuanian Byelorussian, and Ukrainians - whose relations with us have along and complicated history. These nations have to know that from our side they are not threatened by any territorial claims nor by patronizing in the name of the past greatness a matter of principles and the well-conceived Polis national interest.
We have a lot to offer to these countries and they have a lot to offer to Poland however, this may happen only on condition that we will succeed to base our mutual relationships upon trust and close and equal cooperation. This above all requires mutual and rigorous respect for national minorities.
 
However, in our thinking about the security of Poland, we should go beyond the tradition reflection concerning the relationship with the two powerful neighbours present it is not possible to give a clear answer to the question concerning the future system of international security which could guarantee the independence of the Polish state. This is because such an answer depends on the future events in Europe and, first and foremost, in the Soviet Union case, however, it is dangerous to cherish any illusions concerning Polish neutrality and isolation. From the newly established international relationships no one can guarantee the neutrality of the Polish state and any attempts to conduct neutralist policy will result in a situation in which Poland would become an object of the competition of major powers for the spheres ;of influence A present there is no simple prescription for the security of the Polish state which would din guarantee us the position in the international community in accordance with our; aspirations The answer to the present-day dangers, challenges and opportunities should be a dynamic policy of the development of our country as well as active construction of a complex, multilateral system international relations".
In the future, such as new system of relations allow Poland to reach the level of security equal to that of West European democracies This can be achieved through the participation in the new order of European security created upon the basis of the Conference for European Security and Cooperation, that is with the participation of the United States and the Soviet Union This would he the best scenario for Poland. However, should the creation of such an order security be delayed, it will be necessary for Poland to seek closer links with the system of security European democracies which was created after the World War II and is now undergoing reform.

Nowadays the greatest threat for our sovereignty is the technological and economic state of Poland. Today the danger of Poland becoming dependent and insignificant' comes from out economic, technological and financial collapse rather than from a possible territorial aggression of direct use of force by one of our neighbours.


We should do all we can to speed up the process of our transition to the highly developed  European countries, to enter in close economic; diplomatic, political and cultural links with European as well as to create pan-European institution The membership in the Council of Europe, activities participation in the process of the Conference for European Security and Cooperation and even he association with the European Com unity and close cooperation with the East European Union are but the first steps on this way Our purpose  which is united Europe, cannot be quickly and without persistence and determination. 



Regional links are a significant element of the creation of the new European order should encourage the development of and actively participate in, the cooperation in the Baltic region as well as in the Southern part of Europe, in the community of the state in the Danube-Adriatic region (the Pentagonal Group

Central-Eastern Europe, which like us is looking for its way to full independence and democracy, is for Poland a natural and important ally We share with the, countries of this region our democratic aspirations, the dramatic problems of the way out of communism as well as our poking position between the East and the West and the specific security problems which it entails. Together with these countries and in particular with Czechoslovakia and Hungry we should push forward the propositions concerning the way. Western countries could assist us in order to overcome the economic, social and political division of Europe. Together we should maintain the
Stability in the region to prevent the situation where powerful neighbours could dictate their conditions to Central - Eastern Europe.
The United States should be our important partner in the overcoming of the economic collapse 'and in the creation of the structures of security American contribution to maintain balance in Europe among others through its role be NATO is and will remain essential. In today's world -there is no simple; answer to our need for security and significant presence in the international: community. In any case we should conduct an open and dynamic policy, focused on the active search for and realization of opportunities, and not on passive and faint-hearted turning back on the world.

- PACT FOR POLAND
- THE CORE OF THE PROBLEM
A year and a half after Poland started to build the political system based_ upon two principles: the protection of individual liberty and political democracy as well as the fast transition to modern market economy, the Polish state has found itself in peril. This danger consists above al in the uncertainty if the way the internal situation in Poland develops in a way which allows continuing the systemic transformation on the basis of these two principles. The growing number- a indications of social disappointment with the results of the reforms and of protests, against decreasing standards of living is the reason why the postulate to abandon the present pro-capitalist economic policies is put forward not only by the post-communist forces but also by some of the movements and organizations which originated in Solidarity, on both the left and the right of the political spectrum. The Democratic Union believes that the rejection of' this postulate is a precondition of the technological progress of Poland and a gradual improvement of the livid standards of the Polish society. We are convinced that there is no alternative to the capitalist model of the Polish economy.
On the other hand, the threat that the present direction of reforms will be blocked by the avalanche of demands, claims and protests may give rise to the temptation to limit the principle 01 political democracy and the full protection of civil and employees' Liberties. Such thought is encouraged by the tendency of a part of the public opinion to strengthen the policy the restoration of social peace with authoritarian methods. If the disorder of political life increases: intensity, such a tendency may naturally be gaining strength in the near future. The Democratic Union believes that only by rejecting firmly any idea concerning the limitation of employees' liberties, will it be possible to get the Polish state out of the economic crisis and the political chaos. The market-oriented reform of the national economy most be continued and at the same time it is necessary to seek the social consent for the reform. The abandonment of these two principles of the Solidarity revolution most result in the defeat of this revolution,
Democracy, together with individual freedom, and market economy are indivisible. This conviction is for us a matter of principle.
Our reaction to this state of affairs is the proposal of the PACT FOR POLAND - a wide agreement among different social forces whose interests are particular and contradictory. Such a pact ought to restore the democratic consent for the continuation of the reforms. Its starting point should be the recognition that although fair claims and justified demands of social groups cannot be fully satisfied today out of the concern for the common good, none of them* should be; totally neglected. The social model of market economy for which the Democratic Union stands should ensure the participation of different social subjects in determining the shape of the compromise concerning the distribution of the costs of the crisis among various groups of interest. 

Such a compromise should be based on the principle that — firstly no one gets everything but everyone gets something and — secondly — every concession today guarantees profit tomorrow. Only then will it be possible to achieve the situation in which democratic principles do not collide with the demands of the common good. However, the Polish political scene creates certain.

- DIFFICULTIES AND OBSTACLES

- As is the case in other post-communist countries, the Polish political system lacks the element which constitutes the essence of democracy - a mechanism of the emergence, competition and mediation of different interests. Such a mechanism should be created by political parties and different associations expressing the interests of different social groups. However, the existing political parties represent at their best nothing but narrow circles of 'political public", yet even more often only the groups surrounding their ambitious leaders, None of the parties is firmly permanently rooted in the social context. This results in the fact that even Senators and
Members Parliament represents the systems of values, great historical theories and their own rather than the interests of specific groups or regions.
One should not count on the Of this situation in the course of the free parliamentary elections, since it is bard to believe that the political scene can be totally rebuilt till autumn. This is why it seems likely that compromises reached exclusively on the parliamentary grounds might prove insufficient and not widespread acceptance of the public opinion.

Another source of difficulties is the economic structure of the country which constitutes a part of the communist legacy. The government is at present and will remain for a number of years the main and direct or indirect employer. Associations of employers are only being created. Now trade executive bodies hardly control the situation on the grass-root level. 
- Thus no compromise "on the tor can guarantee the real social peace. This is why the concept of the
PACT FOR POLAND cannot aim at such an agreement of the forces which exist on the political Scene. This would block independent local activities. In order to avoid it, the process of the elaboration of the PACT FOR POLAND should involve such initiatives rather than from the participation in the political life and the decision-making process.
Point' of view the PACT FOR POLAND is the contradiction of the agreement of the fact that most workers' and farmers' unions assumed the attitude of putting forward claims and demands creates a danger that the new agreement might lead to the abandonment of the market-oriented economic transformations. The likelihood of such a situation would increase if the negotiations were to be conducted within particular branches of the economy to prolong the period of the adjustment to the new requirements of the market. 

The PACT FOR POLAND would then turn into its contradiction. It is therefore self-evident that the very direction of the market reform cannot be subject either to negotiations or compromise. The goal of negotiations and compromise should be to terminate conflicts the way the costs of the reform are to be distributed among different social groups.
Serious problem remains the fact that political organizations take advantage of the and especially financial, situation of the state to increase their own popularity perceive the increasing number of demagogues active in the political life. 
The promising attitude of the government is treated as an indication of its weakness and results in mores demands. 
Thus if the PACT FOR POLAND is to lead to reasonable long and middleterm compromises, it most be preceded by a gentlemen's agreement among these political forces that - in the name of the superior interest of the state - are willing to create an umbrella over the market reform. Such an agreement would determine the-outline of the real political centre, which is opposed to ideology, extremist politics and demagogy - particularly as far as the economic programs are concerned.  

- ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS OF THE PACT
- POLITICAL PACT
The Democratic Union puts forward a proposal to all the political groups, parties and movements to recognize together, in the form of separate declarations, the following principles:
- The necessity of the market reconstruction and the revival of the national economy as well as the means of achieving them such as the policy of savings and of the balanced budget will not be' questioned and will not become subject of election game. At the same time a discussion of the' economic programs which take this necessity into consideration is needed.
- A limitation or suspension of democratic rules or civil or employees' rights cannot be under any circumstances a means to counter claims and demands or a solution of social problems and conflicts.
3. Regardless of ideological inclinations, all the parties agree that the state should in the first place assist the regions and social groups which are more than others affected by the reform, even though their compensation can by no means be full.
- While recognizing the constitutional liberties concerning the organization of strikes demonstrations and street protests, the political groups will not encourage them among their followers in order not to contribute to possible destabilization of the state. 
The way of the distribution of the costs of the reform among different social groups and the:: claims they involve should become subject to negotiations and compromises on different
We appeal for the recognition of these five different principles to all the political centres in this country. We believe that their immediate acceptance will create an umbrella over the economic reform and may constitute a point of departure for the second phase of the PACT FOR POLAND - i.e. the social pact.

- SOCIAL PACT
The Democratic Union proposes to the representatives of large groups of economic interests, namely hired employees, the public sector employees, individual farmers, private employers, and pensioners, to initiate immediate negotiations on the distribution of the costs of the reforms among different social groups.
The negotiations should start immediately after the parliamentary elections and the' establishment of a new government. Such negotiations should be hosted and monitored by the democratically elected Sejm. We are not proposing here yet another agreement between the; government and the onions. What we are proposing is to get in motion the mechanism of negotiations among the representatives of different groups of interests, with the participation
the government as one of the parties of the compromise. Contradicting interests should be reconciled between the directly concerned parties. We believe that negotiations and compromises should concern the governmental proposals in the following areas:

- assumptions of the income policy together with a list of obstacles for their realization, the proposed income indexes and their possible corrections in the one year period depending on:
- the rate of inflation,
- the increase for decrease of production,
- the scope of our international debt,
- the budget.
- methods of wage control (here negotiations should concern the wage-rise tax and its consultation among the participants of the negotiations.
We emphasize that the compromises most not involve the principle of the market reforms of the national economy. However, it has to determine the necessary costs which we will all share.
Local
Democratic Union proposes to the representatives of regional, local and factory-floor groups whose interests are mutually contradictory and who have different views on the future of local community, town or region to negotiate local compromises in which the of all the participants are partly taken into consideration. We considered it a dangerous situation if the demands concerning contradictory local interests are not negotiated between the parties involved, both are directly referred to the government, usually under the threat of strikes for protest. The deposits concerning the future of a factory which the environment- the direction of the economic development of a local community- or the functioning of rural cooperatives and thousands of other problems of that kind — should be solved in local community. Every local compromise serves the idea of building the PACT FOR POLAND by all of us.
	
The PACT FOR POLAND is not an idea of a particular party. We would not like it to be treated as the property of the Democratic Union. We direction it to everybody who can see the threats which confront today's Poland and is trying to prevent them by a coordinated action.
